Interception at Changi Airport
At about 1800hrs, the 27-year-old female was stopped by both CNB and ICA officers for a more detailed check at the arrival hall. The Thai had arrived on a flight from New Delhi and was to transit to another flight in Singapore when she was stopped by the officers.
Her backpack was screened through the X-ray machine and anomalies were detected in her backpack. The officers also noticed that the weight of the backpack was unusually heavy. The backpack was searched and a big packet of crystalline substances believed to be “Ice”, weighing approximately 3.4kg, was discovered in a false compartment of the backpack. The estimated street value of the drugs found is about $850,000.
The 27-year-old Thai female was immediately placed under arrest. She is being investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, she may face the death penalty.
Continued vigilance by the Home Team
Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security. The enhanced security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  We have tightened our security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “We will not tolerate any drug syndicates who make use of Singapore’s excellent transport infrastructure to carry out drug activities. We will bring the full force of the law against them swiftly and firmly. The Home Team agencies will continue to work together and stamp out these illicit drug activities at the checkpoints.”

 In an operation conducted on 23 October 2012 against a drug syndicate that was suspected to be active in the Tampines area, the Central Narcotics Bureau seized approximately 800 grammes of heroin, 45 grammes of cannabis and a small amount of ‘Ice’, estimated to be worth more than S$85,000.  About S$ 9,000 cash was also seized.  Four men were arrested in this operation. On 23 October 2012, at about 1940hrs, CNB officers, who had been observing the vicinity of a HDB block at Tampines Street 22, spotted the suspected drug trafficker, a 50-year-old male leaving his hideout. At the same time, another team of officers spotted another male (22 years old) on the ground floor of the same block.  Both men were observed to be walking towards the back of the block before they parted. Officers moved in and swiftly placed the 50-year-old male under arrest at the lift landing.  One plastic bag bundle containing approximately 460 grammes of heroin was recovered from the basket attached to his bicycle. Officers led the man to the unit where he was observed to have exited earlier, and from within the unit, recovered approximately 340 grammes of heroin, 45 grammes of cannabis, a small amount of ‘Ice’, one digital weighing scale and other drug paraphernalia.  Cash amounting to S$3,598 was also recovered within the unit.  Two other Singaporean men, a 63-year-old and a 52-year-old, who were inside the unit, were also arrested. Meanwhile, another team of CNB officers who had been tailing the 22-year-old man, a Malaysian national, moved in to effect arrest as he was walking along a pavement.  Cash amounting to S$5,400 was recovered from the man. The 50-year-old, 22-year-old and 63-year-old men are being investigated for drug trafficking.  If convicted, they may face the death penalty.  The 52-year-old is being investigated for drug consumption. CNB will continue with its vigorous enforcement action against illicit drug activities to maintain a strong deterrent presence against both drug traffickers and abusers alike.

Interception at Changi Airport
At about 9.45pm, CNB officers stopped a 38-year-old South African man at the Changi Airport arrival hall for a check. Officers found his behaviour suspicious as he had seemed hesitant and acted nervously. His luggage was screened and ICA officers detected anomalies in the luggage.
The contents of the luggage were emptied, and the luggage was subjected to a further round of screening. The officers pinpointed the source of the anomalies and the corner of the luggage was pried open. CNB officers discovered two trash bags in which crystalline substances were detected.
The total seizure of drugs was approximately 3kg of Ice with a street value of more than $920,000.
The 38-year-old is currently under investigation for drug trafficking. If convicted, he may face the death penalty.
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director CNB, said, “We will not tolerate any drug syndicates to make use of Singapore’s excellent transport connectivity to carry out their nefarious drug activities. We will bring the full force of the law against them, swiftly and firmly. CNB will continue our relentless effort to stamp out the syndicates and all drug offenders.”
CNB will continue to work closely with our Home Team agencies to deter attempts by foreign drug syndicates to smuggle illicit drugs through Singapore’s checkpoints.

7,Amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act,2012-10-15,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/amendments-to-the-misuse-of-drugs-act," Introduction
The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill was introduced for First Reading at the Parliamentary Sitting on 15 October 2012.
Background
The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) provides the legal framework for the control of dangerous or otherwise harmful substances. The Act criminalises the trafficking, manufacturing, importation and exportation, possession and consumption of controlled drugs.
The MDA will be amended to enhance overall deterrence, support enforcement efforts and improve upstream intervention for young abusers. The amendments will also sharpen our regulatory tools and calibrate our legal framework to enable the Government to tackle drug trafficking more effectively.
Key Amendments
The key amendments to the MDA are:

Introduce temporary listing of new psychoactive substances
New psychoactive substances (commonly known as “designer drugs”) are being developed rapidly. The Act will be amended to give the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) the power to seize new psychoactive substances listed in a temporary schedule.  This will restrict circulation of such psychoactive substances while relevant scientific analysis and industry consultation are conducted. Other offences such as trafficking and possession will only apply after the substances have been listed in the relevant permanent schedule.
Introduce hair analysis to enhance detection and deterrence
This amendment will empower law enforcement officers to obtain hair samples. The results of hair analysis may be used as one of the considerations for the Director of the CNB to issue a supervision order or review the conditions of an existing order. This will complement the current framework for urine testing.
Strengthen the punishment framework for repeat drug traffickers and those who traffic drugs to the young and vulnerable, and create a new offence for recruiting them for drug trafficking
Stiffer punishments will be provided for repeat traffickers and those who traffic drugs to young and vulnerable persons.  A new offence will also be created with similar punishments for those who recruit young or vulnerable persons into drug trafficking.
Criminalise organisation of drug gatherings
A new offence will be created which criminalises the organising of drug gatherings. This offence will attract a minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment with the option of caning. For gatherings involving the young and vulnerable, the minimum punishment will be 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.
Provide for a Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC)
The Director of the CNB will have the option of detaining young abusers in a Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC) as a step-down arrangement after a short period of detention in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC). This will allow them to continue with their education or employment during the day, minimize disruption to their daily lives and mitigate the risk of contamination from repeat abusers in the DRC.
Changes to the mandatory death penalty regime for drug trafficking
As announced in Parliament on 9 July 2012, two specific conditions are provided for under which the death penalty will no longer be mandatory for drug trafficking. First, the trafficker must have only played the role of courier, and must not have been involved in any other activity related to the supply or distribution of drugs. Second, discretion will only apply if, having satisfied this first requirement, either the trafficker has cooperated with the CNB in a substantive way, or he has a mental disability which substantially impairs his appreciation of the gravity of the act.
“Substantive cooperation” is defined as “Substantively assisting in CNB’s operations to disrupt drug trafficking activities within or outside of Singapore”, which may include, for example, the provision of information leading to the arrest or detention or prosecution of any person involved in any drug trafficking activity. The law will provide for the Public Prosecutor to issue a “Certificate of Cooperation” where this condition is met. The courts will then have the discretion to sentence the defendant to either the death penalty or life imprisonment. Those sentenced to life imprisonment will also be liable to caning of at least 15 strokes.
In relation to “mental disability”, the language of the current diminished responsibility provision applicable to murder will be adopted. The defendant will need to establish to the courts that he suffers from an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his responsibility for his actions. Persons who are determined to have been acting under a “mental disability” will be sentenced to life imprisonment.
The Bill will also enact transitional provisions which provide that all accused persons who meet the conditions pertaining to the mandatory death penalty can elect to be considered for re-sentencing under the new law.  Procedurally, the accused will be able to apply to the court to admit further evidence if it is unclear from the record of proceedings of his trial and/or appeal as to whether he was a courier, or whether he satisfies one of the conditions. Where applicable, the re-sentencing will take place at the first instance in the High Court, with an appeal to the Court of Appeal. Further, existing cases will also be re-considered for clemency.

More than 800 grammes of heroin and about 100 grammes of Ice, with a street value of more
than S$100,000, were seized.
In the evening of 18 Sep 2012, CNB officers, who had been monitoring the suspected drug traffickers and associates who distributed drugs in Redhill and Geylang areas, swooped in at Pasir Ris and arrested two suspected drug couriers, aged 29 and 31. The
Malaysian duo were believed to have been ferrying fresh consignments of drugs recently received, and had ridden a motorcycle to a meeting place in a carpark in Pasir Ris earlier.
One of them (the 31-year-old) had alighted from the motorcycle and boarded a suspected drug trafficker’s car. A short distance later at a bus stop, the courier alighted from the car and was picked up by the same motorcycle. Both vehicles went off
separately and it was then that CNB officers stopped the motorcycle at a traffic junction, arresting both men. S$2,500 cash was found on the 31-year-old courier.
CNB officers, who had followed the car, stopped the car at a petrol kiosk along Loyang Avenue. Drugs, including approximately 670 grammes of heroin and 70 grammes of Ice, and a weighing scale were recovered from within the car. The 49-year-old Singaporean
driver was immediately put under arrest. Later at night, CNB officers recovered more drugs in his hideout in Pasir Ris – including approximately 85 grammes of heroin, 35 grammes of Ice and empty plastic packets.
Meanwhile, another team of CNB officers deployed at the void deck in an area near Geylang arrested the trafficker’s suspected drug associate, 47 years old. About 60 grammes of heroin, small amounts of Ice and Erimin-5, along with drug trafficking
paraphernalia were found in his hideout in the same block. CNB officers also arrested a suspected 55-year-old Singaporean drug abuser in the unit. Some of the heroin were found hidden in a black rubber shoe in the living room.
All the men are being investigated for drug offences, and the suspected drug trafficker and couriers may face the death penalty if convicted.

Meanwhile, in the vicinity of Alexandra Terrace, another team of CNB officers intercepted the lorry driven by the 41-year-old suspect.  The suspect resisted arrest but was eventually subdued.  CNB officers recovered a blue plastic bag from the lorry and it was found to contain two envelopes with heroin weighing about 230 grammes. Both men are being investigated for drug trafficking.  If convicted, they may face the death penalty. CNB will continue with its vigorous enforcement action against illicit drug activities to maintain a strong deterrent presence against both drug traffickers and abusers alike.

11,CNB and ICA foil two attempts by syndicate to traffic 6.7kg of Ice worth S$1.3mil through Singapore,2012-09-04,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/cnb-and-ica-foil-two-attempts-by-syndicate-to-traffic-6.7kg-of-ice-worth-s1.3mil-through-singapore," The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) continues its tough stance to weed out illicit drug activities in Singapore. Together with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), the agencies successfully foiled two attempts by West African syndicate to traffic about 6.7kg of Ice worth over a million Singapore dollars. The interceptions were made in two separate joint operations between the two agencies at Tuas Checkpoint and Changi Airport.
First interception at Tuas Checkpoint
In the first arrest on 3 September 2012, at about 8am, CNB and ICA officers arrested a 22-year-old Indonesian female while she was about to depart Singapore by bus at the Tuas Checkpoint. CNB officers searched her luggage and recovered 2.9kg of Ice, wrapped in a bag, sandwiched in between two wooden panels. The street value of the drugs was worth about S$580,000.
Second interception at Changi Airport
In the second joint operation between CNB and ICA about 13 hours later, a CNB officer stopped a 40-year-old female Ghanaian at Changi Airport’s Arrival Hall for a routine check. Her luggage was screened and ICA officers detected anomalies in some of the items packed inside her luggage.
CNB officers examined the luggage’s contents closely and found four round blocks of Ice compressed in two sealed food tin cans. Another eleven bundles of Ice were found hidden in two DVD players and a power adapter. More bundles of Ice were found taped and hidden inside two pairs of shoes in the luggage.
The total seizure of the drugs (including the weight of the shoes) was about 3.8kg, with a street value of more than S$770,000. This is the second largest Ice seizure since November 2011.
Investigations against both women are ongoing. If convicted, they may face the death penalty.
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song commented, “We know the West African drug syndicates remain active in the region. CNB will not tolerate any syndicate choosing to leverage on Singapore’s excellent transport connectivity to further their criminal activities here. We will bring the full force of the law against them swiftly and firmly. We would also like to remind Singaporeans not to allow themselves to be made use of by foreign drug syndicates and should reject any suspicious offer of free travel or paid holidays. If unsure, members of public can call CNB.”

Every year on the 26th of June, Singapore joins nations across the world to commemorate the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, also known as the World Drug Day. This day was set aside by the United Nations General Assembly in 1987 as an expression of its determination to achieve the vision of an international society free of drug abuse.
In support of this vision, the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will launch the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign (ADAC) 2012 on 24 June. NCADA and CNB are collaborating with the Singapore Polytechnic, whose students from its School of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE) will help conceptualise and organise a series of anti-drug activities for the campaign.
Commemorative Event @ Open Space outside The Cathay on 23 and 24 June 2012: Singapore’s Largest Phone Wipe Mosaic and launch of the new Drug Buster Academy
The theme of this year’s Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign, or ADAC, is ‘Life Does Not Rewind. Make The Right Choice’. A fun-filled and meaningful two-day event will be held at the open space outside The Cathay from 23 to 24 June 2012 from 11am to 6pm daily to raise awareness of the anti-drug cause among young people and the public. Students from the Singapore Polytechnic will be leading student volunteers from eight schools in an attempt to build Singapore’s largest mosaic made of over 20,000 commemorative phone wipes. Besides watching and cheering the students on, members of public can learn more about the dangers of drug abuse through the exhibitions and game booths at the event. Members of public can also get a sneak preview of the Drug Buster Academy, CNB’s new anti-drug mobile exhibition bus. The Drug Buster Academy will be launched by Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister of State for Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs, who will be Guest-of-Honour at the event on 24 June. Over 260 student volunteers will also be distributing the commemorative phone wipes island-wide on 23, 24 and 30 June.
Anti-Addiction Affair 2012: Unmask the Truth Challenge @ Addiction Mall from 18 to 20 July 2012
This year, CNB and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) have teamed up to organise a series of “adventure workshops” from 18 to 20 July 2012, known as the Anti-Addiction Affair 2012: Unmask the Truth Challenge. Targeted at Upper Primary and Lower Secondary school students, participants will have to put on their detective hats and embark on a hunt to solve substance abuse-related ‘crimes’. The students would learn the costly impact of smoking, alcohol and drugs addiction through their ‘investigation’, the interactive games and puzzles, and the first-hand account from an ex-drug abuser. These adventures will take place at the newly refurbished Addiction Mall located at HPB’s HealthZone.
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, Central Narcotics Bureau, said, “Tough laws and rigorous enforcement, together with effective preventive drug education, have helped keep the drug situation in Singapore under control. The Central Narcotics Bureau is glad to be able to collaborate with the National Council Against Drug Abuse and Singapore Polytechnic again for this year’s Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign. It is critical that we inculcate anti-drug awareness amongst the public and the community through preventive education, so that they understand the physical harms and social costs brought by drugs.”
In addition, a series of exciting anti-drug activities have been planned from July to September 2012. Some of the highlights include:

Commemorative phone wipes packaged with information on the World Drug Day and the Anti-Drug Ribbon will be distributed to all students. School leaders are also encouraged to read out NCADA Chairman’s World Drug Day message on 10 July 2012, urging students to make a firm stand against drug abuse.
An online anti-drug quiz for the public and schools will be held in July 2012 to raise greater awareness of the dangers of drug and inhalant abuse.
A series of roving anti-drug exhibitions with booth games will visit various locations around the island from July to August 2012 to spread the anti-drug message to the youths.
Sportzamania, a popular sports carnival organised by CNB since 2006, will be held in September 2012. It aims to encourage youths to lead a healthy, drug-free lifestyle through fun sports and carnival activities.

(Please refer to Annex A for the list of events planned for this year’s Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign and Annex B for a picture of the phone wipe.)
“The International Day Against Drugs demonstrates that drug abuse is a global issue that has to be tackled together with determination and cohesion. Singapore faces stiff challenges in the form of an increasing supply of drugs from the region. Given a weakening economic climate, many governments have shifted their focus away from the fight against drugs. The long term repeat drug abusers who would be released from Prisons in the next three years could also pose a contamination risk on our youth. Thus, the National Council Against Drug Abuse, together with the Central Narcotics Bureau, believes that preventive education is crucial in preventing people from getting started on drugs in the first place. We will continue to work hard with our partners to educate the public on the dangers and consequences of drug abuse and work towards a safe and drug-free environment for future generations of Singaporeans. Clearly, the World Drug Day shows that we are not alone in this fight,” said Dr N Varaprasad, Chairman of the National Council Against Drug Abuse.
The Council hopes that the public will support the range of commemorative activities planned and help us spread the anti-drug message to the people around them.

A total of approximately 2.9kg of Ice and 450 grammes of heroin were seized, valued at S$644,800.
The first operation took place on 21 May 12 at around 3pm at Changi Airport Terminal 1’s arrival hall. CNB officers had found two boxes containing 12 lead pistons in a check-in nylon baggage carried by a female West African. With the assistance of officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, anomalies were spotted in the x-ray images of the pistons being scanned.
The pistons were prised open by officers and packets of crystalline substances, believed to be Ice, were found hidden in each piston. Approximately 2.7kg of Ice was found, worth more than half a million dollars, this year’s largest seizure to date.
The 28-year-old West African, who had with her about eight different currencies, was immediately placed under arrest. The suspected drug courier is being investigated for drug importation. If convicted, she may face the death penalty.
Meanwhile, CNB officers were deployed in the same afternoon to Bukit Batok West, where they intercepted a car at a junction in Bukit Batok West Avenue. CNB officers arrested a 38-year-old male Singaporean after a short chase. In his attempt to escape, he had thrown away a blue plastic bag. The plastic bag was retrieved and was found to contain two brown envelopes of substances, believed to be heroin, weighing approximately 450 grammes (about 1,600 straws of heroin). About 125 grammes of Ice were found on the floor mat of the front passenger seat of the car. The suspected drug trafficker is being investigated for the offence of drug trafficking and may face the death penalty if convicted.
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director CNB, said, “Let this be a warning to the West African drug syndicates still active in the region. We will not tolerate any drug syndicates, West African or otherwise, to make use of Singapore’s excellent transport connectivity to carry out their drug activities. We will bring the full force of the law against them, swiftly and firmly. CNB will continue our relentless effort to stamp out the syndicates.”

Singapore resolves to continue its zero-tolerance approach towards drug abuse.
The Taskforce on Drugs (Taskforce) formed in October 2011 and chaired by Minister of State (Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs), Mr Masagos Zulkifli, has completed its work in reviewing the current drug abuse situation.
In combating drug abuse, Singapore faces the dual challenges of a worsening regional drug supply situation, and the changing attitudes of young people towards drug abuse.  In particular, the rising numbers of repeat and young new drug abusers arrested are areas of concern.
The Taskforce has recommended a comprehensive approach to tackle the drug situation; covering targeted prevention, strong deterrence and enforcement, upstream intervention for young abusers, rehabilitation and supervision to prevent relapse, and active engagement of families and the community to support the fight against drugs.
Summing up the recommendations of the Taskforce, Minister of State (Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs), Mr Masagos Zulkifli, emphasised in his speech at the Central Narcotics Bureau Workplan Seminar 2012:
“We will continue to be tough on drugs and forge a national consensus of zero-tolerance of drug abuse.”
“While the government and the community will support the ex-drug abuser and facilitate his successful reintegration, it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual not to relapse or negatively influence others. If he does, he will have to face the consequences of his actions – swiftly and surely.”
MOS Mr Masagos Zulkifli will chair an inter-agency steering committee to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.

Ready for Challenges, Building for the Future
Last year, CNB commemorated its 40th Anniversary. We took stock of what we have done in the past which we can improve upon. We also looked at what we need to do differently in the future as new challenges emerge and our operating environment changes.
The theme for this year’s CNB Work Plan Seminar - ‘Ready for Challenges, Building for the Future’ - reaffirms what we have reviewed. That we are aware of the challenges facing us and we are putting in place building blocks to tackle the challenges head-on.
Tough Enforcement Remains Key
Tough and vigorous drug law enforcement remains fundamental to CNB’s approach towards drug control. While emerging challenges may change the context of our operating environment, our two-pronged strategy of supply and demand reduction remains relevant. We need to stem the supply of drugs in Singapore to make it as difficult as possible for drug abusers to have access to illicit drugs. On the demand side, we need to suppress drug abuse by promptly detecting and rehabilitating drug abusers until they are able to lead a life without drugs.
Recap of CNB’s Enforcement Efforts
Since 1971, CNB has been the key agency responsible for drug law enforcement in Singapore, safeguarding our philosophy of zero tolerance towards drug abuse. To stem the supply of drugs in Singapore, CNB had built up intelligence capabilities to deal with the increased sophistication of transnational and local drug trafficking syndicates. We also brought the fight beyond Singapore by deepening cooperation with our key foreign partners. Since year 2000, CNB had conducted 53 joint operations[1] with Malaysia’s Narcotics Crime Investigation Department, in a concerted effort to tackle the problem upstream. In Singapore, we have also crippled an average of 26 drug trafficking syndicates per year over the same period.
CNB had also built a strong presence at the various entry points. Working closely with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, we conducted high intensity checks and joint operations to detect and deter the flow of drugs into Singapore.
On the demand front, CNB had sustained a high tempo enforcement strategy through regular anti-drug raids and island-wide operations to weed out drug offenders. This will be the hallmark of CNB’s operations and it will continue. To complement our enforcement efforts, we took over the remaining drug related investigations functions from the Police in April last year. This would give us a holistic view of all drug related arrests in Singapore and ensure that drug offenders are dealt with promptly and consistently.
Enforcement – Challenges Ahead
Despite the successes we have had in keeping the local drug situation under control, we are experiencing headwinds ahead of us. We have seen a gradual increase of number of drug abusers over the past 3 years. More than 90% of these abusers are heroin or methamphetamine abusers. Over the next 3 years, we are also expecting a large number of long term repeat drug abusers to be released from Prisons. These abusers exhibit a higher propensity to relapse and will pose a contaminating influence on other abusers and the public.
We are also seeing a worsening drug situation in the region. In the first 3 months of this year alone, our counterparts in Malaysia have seized drugs worth 16.8 million ringgit. This is almost half of what they have seized for the whole of last year. This will definitely have an impact on our local drug scene.
Enforcement – Strategies arising from Drug Task Force
While tough and vigorous drug law enforcement remains fundamental, we will have to adjust our methods and strengthen our capabilities in response to these emerging threats. To this end, recommendations from the Taskforce on Drugs in two key areas of strengthening the legislative framework and CNB’s capabilities will ensure that we remain effective on the ground.
As highlighted by MOS Masagos earlier, amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act will be made to strengthen the punishment regime for drug traffickers.
Under the MDA, we will also introduce a new framework to control new psychoactive substances that have no legitimate industrial or pharmaceutical use. This will allow us to deal with new emerging substance of abuse proactively.
On the enforcement front, intelligence must continue to be the cornerstone of CNB drug enforcement strategy. We will enhance our capabilities to ensure that our intelligence coverage remains effective on the ground as well as helping us to deploy our resources more efficiently.  We will also build on our strategic intel  capabilities so that we are able to anticipate developments in the drug situation and take decisive pre-emptive actions. This would include enhancing our research and analytical capabilities to better understand the profile of abusers and determine the drug trend.
We recognise that technology is a force multiplier and will leverage on technology for effective control of the drug situation. For example, CNB will adopt the use of hair analysis to supplement existing technologies in our enforcement work. This will greatly enhance our detection capabilities, achieve a higher deterrence on drug abuse and complement our efforts to better supervise ex-drug abusers. CNB will also work with our Home Team partners and leverage on existing platforms to further our technology exploration efforts. These will include drug detection, forensics and other law enforcement applications.
Importance of Upstream Intervention – Preventive Education
However, CNB is not all just about tough and rigorous enforcement. Since 1994, CNB has also been given the mandate to lead and coordinate Preventive Drug Education or PDE efforts. This is critical to forge and sustain our national consensus of zero tolerance towards drug abuse. Besides garnering community support for a drug free Singapore, successful upstream intervention can help to reduce the substantial downstream cost associated with drug addiction.
Preventive Drug Education – 1994 to present
CNB’s PDE efforts have systemically targeted primary and secondary schools and community groups. We have in place multiple platforms to disseminate PDE within the education system to ensure that no student is left unaware of the dangers of drug abuse. Our initiatives in the community such as the annual anti-drug abuse campaign have also created greater awareness among the general public on the importance of supporting the anti-drug cause.
CNB’s PDE strategies have continually adapted to the changing environment and demographics of the target audience, pioneering interest based platforms to reach out to more youths. For example, DanceWorks!, which was started in 1999, is into its 14th run. To date, more than 15,000 youths have taken part in the competition, and later, one of the winning team from this year’s DanceWorks! competition will be showing us their winning performance.
In the latest NCADA Youth Perception Survey conducted in 2009, 92% of the participants surveyed were confident that they can say no to drugs. This is a reflection of the effectiveness of our PDE efforts.
Preventive Drug Education – Challenges ahead
However, with the more liberal societal attitudes and values as well as more choices and interests competing for youth’s attention, ensuring that our PDE messages reach out to the right target group has become increasingly challenging. We are seeing a rising number of young drug abusers arrested in recent years. This can be attributed to factors such as changes in attitudes that include permissive use of drugs. We have also observed strong peer contamination, which further compounds the problem.
PDE – Strategies arising from the Task Force
We are concerned about this trend. This group of young abusers could potentially form the next generation of drug addicts, perpetuating the drug abuse cycle within our society. To address this, CNB will increase collaborations with educational institutions, government agencies and the community to ensure that PDE messages and programmes reach our target audience.
CNB’s PDE efforts will take on a more calibrated approach by targeting at-risk groups such as out-of-school youths. These groups tend to be more susceptible to drug abuse and timely PDE has to be disseminated to prevent them from getting involved in drugs. CNB has begun to create specialised PDE programmes for out-of-school and at-risk youths through activities that foster teamwork and build up their confidence, as well as to internalise the anti-drug messages.
Besides at-risk groups, CNB efforts will also reach out more to students from institutes of higher learning and full-time national servicemen, through innovative and interactive offerings that will appeal to this generation of youths.
Beyond PDE – Diversionary measures for young abusers
For the young abusers who have slipped through our PDE outreach, there is a need for them to be properly rehabilitated and reintegrated back into society. Following up from the Young Drug Reporting Centre which CNB has set up earlier this year, we will work with our partners, such as MCYS and community partners to implement the Enhanced Drug Supervision Scheme (or Enhanced DSO).
The Enhanced DSO will be supplemented with counselling and casework to reduce the risk of young abusers from relapsing back into drug abuse. To do this, the young abusers would be assessed holistically and objectively to determine his or her optimal rehabilitation pathway.
Conclusion
To sum up, the fight against drugs is a constant battle that CNB cannot fight alone. This is a battle that many countries have given up, tolerating drug addiction within their society. This is not something we want for our society. My officers have experienced first-hand on a daily basis, the untold harm and damages that drug addiction has done to the abuser and his/her family. We need everybody to come on board and fight this battle together.
To my officers, our job is not going to be easy moving forward. But I have confidence that with the building blocks we are putting in place now, and with our passion for the cause, we will be able to overcome the challenges together and make Singapore a safer place to live in.
On this note, I thank our guests for taking time off to attend CNB Workplan Seminar  and I am also looking forward to having a fruitful session with my officers.
Thank you.

Arrests were made all across the island, including Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bendemeer, Bukit Merah, Clementi, Geylang Bahru, Joo Chiat, Jurong, Marsiling, Orchard, Upper Boon Keng, Whampoa and Yishun.
In total, 78 suspected drug offenders were arrested and drugs worth more than S$360,000 were seized, including approximately 2.16kg of heroin and 230 grammes of ‘Ice’.
‘Essence of Drugs’? 
In the morning of 10 April, CNB officers raided a HDB unit in Marsiling and arrested two male (52 and 37 years old) and one female Singaporean (42 years old) within. About 300 grammes of heroin and 5 grammes of ‘Ice’, worth approximately S$46,000, were seized from the raid. During the operation, officers also seized two bottles of chicken essence found to contain an unknown powdery substance. The powdery substance has since been sent to the Health Sciences Authority for tests to determine its composition. The 37-year-old male and the female have been charged for drug trafficking. If convicted, they may face the death penalty. The 52-year-old male Singaporean has been admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre.
‘Drug Provision Store’ in Clementi
In the afternoon of 11 April, CNB officers raided another HDB unit in Clementi and arrested two male Singaporeans (54 and 50 years old) and a 40-year-old female Singaporean. Officers seized a cocktail of drugs from within the unit, including approximately 200 grammes of heroin, 4 grammes of ‘Ice’, some small amount of ‘Subutex’ and two ‘Ecstasy’ tablets. The drugs are estimated to have a street worth of more than S$32,000. The 50-year-old male has been charged for drug trafficking and the 54-year-old male has been admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre. Investigations on the female drug offender are ongoing.
Forced Entry into Drug Abuser Den
In the morning of 12 April, CNB officers raided two HDB apartments in the same block in Upper Boon Keng Road, where suspected drug activities were believed to be taking place. At the first unit, the occupants refused to comply with instructions to allow officers access into the unit. Forced entry was effected and officers swiftly placed the occupants under arrest. Five male Singaporeans were arrested within for suspected drug abuse. A small amount of heroin, ‘Ice’ and some drug paraphernalia were recovered from the occupants and the unit. Investigations into their drug activities are ongoing.
At the second unit in the same block, another team of CNB officers arrested a 27-year-old male Singaporean and seized a small amount of heroin and six small packets of ‘Ice’ from the unit. Drug paraphernalia, such as a weighing scale and numerous empty plastic packets, were also seized. He will be investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, he may face a minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.
Following up from the raids at the two units in Upper Boon Keng, CNB officers established that another HDB apartment in Geylang Bahru may be the hideout of a street pusher. A follow-up operation to apprehend the trafficker was launched immediately. In the ensuing raid on the unit at Geylang Bahru, officers arrested one male and one female Singaporean, both 24 years old. A small packet of ‘Ice’ was seized from within the unit, and also various drug paraphernalia, including a mini weighing scale and empty plastic packets. The female suspect has been admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre and the male suspect will be investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, he may face a minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.
Pre-Dawn Surprise for Two Drug Traffickers in Orchard Road
CNB has been investigating into the suspected drug trafficking activities of a 54-year-old male Singaporean for some months. On 13 April, CNB launched a pre-dawn operation against the suspected drug trafficker.
At about 5am on 13 April, a suspected drug courier was spotted with his motorcycle in the vicinity of Far East Shopping Centre in Orchard. CNB officers noticed that he seemed to be awaiting the arrival of someone. Separately, the suspected drug trafficker was spotted arriving in the vicinity in a taxi, and both persons were observed meeting up in the vicinity. CNB officers moved in immediately and arrested both suspects after they have gone off on their separate ways.
The suspected courier, a 24-year-old Malaysian, was surprised by the officers and did not resist arrest. A brown envelope that he was carrying was seized and found to contain cash totaling about S$10,400.
The suspected trafficker sensed danger and disposed a sling bag he had been carrying and took flight. Officers caught up with him after a short chase and placed him under arrest. Officers recovered the sling bag which was discarded by him earlier and from within the bag, officers recovered about 960 grammes of heroin, estimated to have a street worth of S$144,000, packed in two black-taped bundles. A straw of heroin and a small flip-knife were also found within the bag.
Both men will be investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, they may face the death penalty.
Director CNB, Mr Ng Ser Song said, “In an intensive week of operations, CNB seized a sizeable amount of drugs and arrested a large number of drug traffickers, street-level pushers and drug abusers alike. This continuous sustained week-long effort is a testament to CNB’s dedication to keeping Singapore’s streets safe from drug activities. We will spare no effort against all drug offenders, big or small.”

Officers recovered the sling bag which was discarded by him earlier and from within the bag, officers recovered about 960 grammes of heroin, estimated to have a street worth of S$144,000, packed in two black-taped bundles. A straw of heroin and a small flip-knife were also found within the bag. Both men will be investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, they may face the death penalty. Director CNB, Mr Ng Ser Song said, “In an intensive week of operations, CNB seized a sizeable amount of drugs and arrested a large number of drug traffickers, street-level pushers and drug abusers alike. This continuous sustained week-long effort is a testament to CNB’s dedication to keeping Singapore’s streets safe from drug activities.

Surprised at Upper Changi
As part of its ongoing fight against drug syndicates in Singapore, CNB had been on the look-out for two male Singaporean drug traffickers, one 30-year-old and the other, a 50-year-old, believed to have been lying low following the recent blitz of anti-drug operations. The 50-year-old is wanted by CNB for other drug trafficking offences. On 19 March, CNB launched an operation against the group. In the evening of 19 March, CNB officers spotted the 50-year-old suspect in the vicinity of Upper Changi Road North with a 48-year-old female companion. CNB officers moved in and arrested both persons, recovering about 610 grammes of cannabis and three Ecstasy tablets from the man. The 48-year-old female was also wanted by CNB for drug consumption offence.
CNB officers led the couple to an apartment the pair were renting in the vicinity and recovered a small amount of ‘Ice’ and various drug paraphernalia, including a digital weighing scale. Officers also recovered cash amounting to about S$1,600.
During the search of the unit, the 48-year-old female suspect suddenly turned hysterical, grabbing two fruit knives lying on a table in an attempt to hurt herself. CNB officers managed to restrain the female suspect, who resisted with a violent struggle. In the process, two CNB officers were injured and bitten by the female suspect. Investigations into the couple are ongoing - the male Singaporean is being investigated for drug trafficking and his female companion for drug consumption.
Raids at Joo Chiat Place
Following the arrest of the 50-year-old suspected drug supplier, another team of CNB officers deployed to watch for the 30-year-old suspected drug trafficker spotted him in the vicinity of Joo Chiat Place and moved in for the arrest. The man had been holding on to an envelope later found to contain a small packet of ketamine and two Ecstasy tablets. A 34-year-old male suspected drug abuser was also arrested in the vicinity.
The 30-year-old suspected drug trafficker led CNB officers to a unit of a private residential block in Joo Chiat Place where CNB officers arrested another seven persons suspected to be involved in drug activities in the unit. Another unit in the same residential block was also raided by CNB officers where a male Singaporean and a female Vietnamese national were also arrested. A small packet of “Ice” and cash amounting to about S$4,170 were recovered from the female’s handbag. A total of approximately 130 grammes of cannabis, 1,500 Erimin-5 tablets, a small packet of ketamine, and various drug paraphernalia, including a digital weighing scale, numerous empty plastic sachets and improvised drug smoking apparatus, were also recovered from the second unit.
Investigations into all the suspects’ drug activities are currently ongoing. Those convicted in court for drug trafficking will face a minimum penalty of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.
Deputy Director CNB Mr Marvin Sim commended the officers involved in the operation. Mr Sim said, “The officers’ keen situational awareness was crucial to disrupting the drug syndicate activities.

The syndicate leader and five others, including his associate and clients, were arrested. Over 6,800 Erimin 5 tablets, 420 Ecstasy tablets, 360 grammes of Ketamine and 140 grammes of Ice, with a street value of more than S$106,400, were seized from the syndicate. Cash amounting to more than S$32,000, believed to be illicit proceeds from drug trafficking, was also recovered.
The syndicate, led by a 39-year-old male Singaporean, is believed to be a key distributor of drugs such as Erimin 5, Ecstasy, Ice and Ketamine in Singapore, with an extended network of runners and couriers working under him. His drug clients would order the drugs directly from him, after which the syndicate leader would task his runners to deliver the drugs and collect the payments.
After a period of monitoring, CNB officers moved to arrest the drug syndicate leader and two of his drug clients at the lift landing of an apartment block in the vicinity of Farrer Park. The three men had resisted arrest and the 39-year-old syndicate leader managed to throw a bunch of keys and a mobile phone into the lift gap, which were later retrieved. Another male Chinese, aged 30, was also arrested by CNB officers inside a vehicle parked below the Farrer Park flat. CNB officers recovered three grammes of Ice in the vehicle.  CNB officers then searched the Farrer Park hideout of the syndicate leader and recovered Ice and Ecstasy hidden in drawers and shelves in the flat as well as cash amounting to S$14,000 inside a safe.
Separately, another team of CNB officers, who were monitoring another suspected hideout of the syndicate in Bedok South, arrested two more male Chinese at the staircase landing of the block that same evening. One was believed to be the 37-year-old associate of the drug syndicate leader while the other was a 39-year-old suspected drug abuser, who had kept a chopper in his vehicle.  A variety of drugs, drug-trafficking and drug-taking paraphernalia and more than S$18,000 in cash were recovered from the two men and the hideout. Over 6,800 Erimin 5 tablets, 390 Ecstasy tablets, 360 grammes of Ketamine and 95 grammes of Ice were seized from the hideout in Bedok South.
All are Singaporeans and they are being investigated for drug offences. Drug trafficking carries a minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.
CNB will continue to keep up the pressure on illicit drug activities in Singapore with its vigorous enforcement action, systematically targeting all levels of illicit drug activities including abusers, street pushers and distributors.

8 MARCH 2012











Drugs, cash and other items seized by CNB Swiftly following the operation in Geylang on 7 Mar 2012, the Central Narcotics Bureau launched another operation in the morning targeting a drug syndicate which was distributing a variety of illicit drugs all over Singapore. The syndicate leader and five others, including his associate and clients, were arrested. Over 6,800 Erimin 5 tablets, 420 Ecstasy tablets, 360 grammes of Ketamine and 140 grammes of Ice, with a street value of more than S$106,400, were seized from the syndicate. Cash amounting to more than S$32,000, believed to be illicit proceeds from drug trafficking, was also recovered. The syndicate, led by a 39-year-old male Singaporean, is believed to be a key distributor of drugs such as Erimin 5, Ecstasy, Ice and Ketamine in Singapore, with an extended network of runners and couriers working under him. His drug clients would order the drugs directly from him, after which the syndicate leader would task his runners to deliver the drugs and collect the payments. After a period of monitoring, CNB officers moved to arrest the drug syndicate leader and two of his drug clients at the lift landing of an apartment block in the vicinity of Farrer Park. The three men had resisted arrest and the 39-year-old syndicate leader managed to throw a bunch of keys and a mobile phone into the lift gap, which were later retrieved. Another male Chinese, aged 30, was also arrested by CNB officers inside a vehicle parked below the Farrer Park flat. CNB officers recovered three grammes of Ice in the vehicle.  CNB officers then searched the Farrer Park hideout of the syndicate leader and recovered Ice and Ecstasy hidden in drawers and shelves in the flat as well as cash amounting to S$14,000 inside a safe. Separately, another team of CNB officers, who were monitoring another suspected hideout of the syndicate in Bedok South, arrested two more male Chinese at the staircase landing of the block that same evening. One was believed to be the 37-year-old associate of the drug syndicate leader while the other was a 39-year-old suspected drug abuser, who had kept a chopper in his vehicle.  A variety of drugs, drug-trafficking and drug-taking paraphernalia and more than S$18,000 in cash were recovered from the two men and the hideout. Over 6,800 Erimin 5 tablets, 390 Ecstasy tablets, 360 grammes of Ketamine and 95 grammes of Ice were seized from the hideout in Bedok South.

14-Hour Joint Operation
In an operation targeting street-level drug trafficking and abuse in the side streets of Geylang and various eastern parts of Singapore, including Circuit Road, Chai Chee, Bedok, Tampines, Haig Road and Geylang Serai, 60 suspected drug offenders were arrested. An assortment of drugs, including approximately 28 grammes of heroin, 20 grammes of ‘Ice’ and a small amount of cannabis were seized from the operation.
Attempted escape on wheels
As part of the extended operation, anti-drug rounds were conducted at the Circuit Road area.  CNB officers spot-checked a female on bicycle in the vicinity but she attempted to evade arrest by cycling away.  CNB officers arrested the female after a short chase on foot and 20 straws of heroin weighing approximately 19 grammes, meant to be peddled to drug addicts on the street, were recovered from the female. She is currently being investigated for drug trafficking.
Raids at Geylang
Spot-checks were also carried out in various hotels in the Geylang area as part of the intensive operation.  During one of the checks in Lorong 16 Geylang, a forced entry was effected when an occupant of a room refused to grant officers access to the room despite repeated requests by officers.  The male occupant of the room resisted but was eventually put under arrest by officers.  One sachet of cannabis was recovered in the room. He is being investigated for consumption of a controlled drug.
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song commended the officers involved in the operation.  Mr Ng said, “To keep the drug situation in check, CNB will continue to work closely with our fellow Home Team counterparts to intensify our enforcement efforts on the ground.”

Co-organised by the National Council Against Drug Abuse
(NCADA) and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) since 1999, this annual nationwide dance competition has attracted participation from more than 15,000 youths under 25 years who believe in leading and spreading the word of an active drug-free lifestyle.

Bringing DanceWorks! to a new generation
DanceWorks! enjoys a loyal following amongst youths who return year-in and year-out to compete on the dance floor. Amongst these include the charismatic all-boys hip-hop dance group, “Super Duper Junior”, from the Anglo-Chinese Primary School
who were the first runner-up of Category I (for youths aged under 13 years) last year. First formed 10 years ago, some of its members have been dancing together since they were in Primary 1. Many of its members who are about to graduate from the school
would undoubtedly be doing their utmost to help the team clinch the championship title this year.
At the same time, some 43 teams will be taking part in DanceWorks! for the first time. The “SideSteppers Crew” from ITE College West explained that they joined DanceWorks! to “compete with some of the best throughout the nation”,
while the “Jaggers” from Blangah Rise Primary School said they wanted to inspire others “not to get mixed up with drugs and waste their lives away”. Befitting their name, the “Vigorous Fusion Crew”  energetically proclaimed “We don’t need drugs, we only need to dance!”.
Saying NO to drugs through Dance
One of the biggest dance competitions in the country, and the only one with an anti-drug theme, DanceWorks! aims to let participants have fun while internalising and sharing the anti-drug message. With this in mind, demonstration of the anti-drug theme
in the dance performance is a compulsory judging criterion which takes up 40% of the overall score. Indeed, feedback gathered from a sample of almost 200 DanceWorks! 2011 participants showed that 97% of them indicated that they were discouraged from
abusing drugs and 98% understood the serious consequences of drug abuse after taking part in the competition, testifying to its effectiveness as a platform to spread the anti-drug message. Having the competition rounds at popular shopping malls like
Toa Payoh HDB Hub, VivoCity and Ngee Ann City ensures that the anti-drug message will be spread wider.
DanceWorks! 2012 performances will be judged by experienced professionals from the dance and artistic fields, with participants standing to win over $70,000 in cash and other prizes. Aspiring dancers can look forward to bringing home the newly minted
Pokka Most Sparklin’ Dancer Award trophy (together with $100 cash and a Pokka hamper) if the judges pick any of them as the most outstanding dancer in each competition round. (See Table 2 in the DanceWorks! 2012 Fact Sheet for details).
Dr N Varaprasad, Chairman, NCADA said, “The increasing number of youth abusers arrested is a serious concern to us.  If this continues, there is a danger that they could form the next generation of drug abusers. We need to step up on our preventive drug education efforts, particularly targeted at the young people, in order to maintain our zero-tolerance stance against drug abuse.  The Council will continue to work closely with CNB and the relevant community partners to organise creative and interesting outreach programmes to spread the anti-drug message to more youths and community groups.”
Mr Terence Tan, Director, Communications Division, CNB added, “DanceWorks! has been a platform for youths to showcase their talents while demonstrating to fellow youths how they can lead a healthy and drug-free lifestyle.  While the competition has been going on for so many years now, we are continually impressed by the participants' performances; the amount of effort they put into their choreography, costumes, and bringing across the anti-drug message often left me astounded. It is the incredible commitment of the participants, their schools and parents that encourages CNB to continue organising such activities to give a stage for youths to realise their dreams.”

On 21 Feb 2012 at about 7.00 pm, with the assistance of the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), a Malaysian registered taxi departing Singapore at the Woodlands Checkpoint was stopped for checks. Upon searching the taxi, CNB officers recovered a luggage from the car boot belonging to a female Malaysian passenger in the taxi. Further inspection of the luggage revealed a crystalline substance hidden in the inner lining of the luggage. About 2.3kg of crystal methamphetamine or ‘Ice’ was seized and is estimated to be worth about $460,000.
The female passenger, a 29-year-old Malaysian woman was placed under arrest. The Malaysian woman was believed to have collected the drug consignment earlier from an African woman in Singapore. In a follow-up operation on the same night, CNB officers arrested the African woman at a guesthouse in the vicinity of Serangoon Road. The African woman, a 32-year-old female Ghanian, was believed to have checked out from another budget hotel upon handing over the drug consignment to the Malaysian woman before transferring to the guesthouse.
Both women are being investigated for exporting and trafficking in the controlled drug methamphetamine respectively. If convicted, they may face the death penalty.
Director Central Narcotics Bureau Mr Ng Ser Song said, “This is a warning to the West African drug syndicates still active in the region. While Singapore’s excellent transport connectivity makes us an attractive transport node for drug syndicates in the region, CNB will not tolerate any syndicate choosing to conduct their activities here, and we will bring the full force of the law against them swiftly and firmly. Together with our regional counterparts, we will continue to monitor and target such criminal syndicates. We would also like to remind Singaporeans not to allow themselves to be made use of by foreign drug syndicates and should reject any suspicious offer of free travel or paid holidays. If unsure, members of public can call CNB.”

Officers from CNB’s Supervision Division were out in full force islandwide, including areas such as Bukit Merah, Tanglin Halt, Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and Jurong, to distribute goodie bags to 223 needy elderly living alone at homes with limited or no family support. The goodie bags contained 12 items of daily necessities such as rice, canned food, washing detergent, and toilet paper. CNB officers purchased the items from staff donations before packaging and distributing the goodie bags personally.
Part of CNB’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to encourage staff to give back to the community, this has become an annual event for officers in the Supervision Division since 2007. CNB officers this year sought to contribute to the elderly beneficiaries under the Lions Befrienders Service Association, a voluntary welfare organisation whose core mission is to reach out to lonely seniors through various community programmes.
After deducting the amount used to purchase the items from suppliers, the rest of the donations collected by the officers amounting to about one thousand dollars were also given to the Association. Director Supervision Mr Gerard Anthony said, “We experience firsthand, the sadness and suffering by the abusers’ families in the course of our daily work. This meaningful event allows us to set aside a bit of time and money to do our part to help the needy in our society.”
Mr Goh Boo Han, Executive Director of Lions Befrienders said, “We appreciate very much the material support given by CNB to our beneficiaries, but more importantly, the human contact provided by the officers during their engagement with the seniors is a socio-emotional support that is much needed for these lonely seniors.”

In the intensive operation which lasted 48 hours from 8 Feb 2012 to 10 Feb 2012, a total of 89 drug offenders were arrested. Out of which, 8 were suspected to be involved in drug trafficking and 81 for drug abuse. Areas raided by CNB officers covered various part of Singapore including Ang Mo Kio, Balam Road, Balestier, Bishan, Bukit Batok, Circuit Road, Joo Chiat and North Bridge Road.
A total of about 500 grammes of cannabis, 65 grammes of heroin, 63.65 grammes of Ice and 140 Erimin 5 and Ecstasy tablets, worth approximately $48,300, were seized.
Raids at Circuit Road
One of the cases in the 48-hour operation illustrated the wide sphere of the harmful influence of drugs. In the early afternoon on 8 Feb 2012, CNB officers staked out the HDB unit of a suspected heroin trafficker in the vicinity of Circuit Road. The officers eventually saw two male Singaporeans, one aged 58 years and the other, 32 years, leaving the HDB unit. At about 2.30pm, the officers moved in to arrest them and found the 32-year-old with one straw of heroin kept in a cigarette packet, inside his Bermudas pocket.
CNB officers then moved in to raid the HDB unit, and arrested another 46-year-old Singaporean woman inside it. A search of the woman uncovered a yellow pouch in her pants’ pocket, and it was found to contain six straws of heroin and several empty straws. Preliminary investigations revealed that the 58-year-old man was her heroin supplier and she was peddling the drugs to others, including the 32-year-old man. CNB officers followed up with an operation the very same day to seek out more of the woman’s drug clients. At about 10pm, officers raided a HDB unit at nearby Balam Road and arrested a 43-year-old suspected drug abuser.
The 58-year old man and 46-year-old woman will be investigated for drug trafficking while the 32-year-old and 43-year-old men will be investigated for drug consumption.
Drug Trafficker Arrested at Joo Chiat Hotel
In another case on 9 Feb 2012 at around 1pm, CNB officers arrested a 27-year-old male Malaysian on suspicion of drug trafficking in a Joo Chiat hotel room. The unemployed man was believed to be distributing drugs from the hotel room, and would move from hotel to hotel to evade arrest.  It was suspected that he had just received a new consignment of drugs and was planning to redistribute it onto the streets. An assortment of drugs and drug utensils were found in the room. In total, about 500 grammes of cannabis, 63 grammes of Ice, 100 Erimin 5 tablets and 40 Ecstasy tablets, worth more than S$37,600, were recovered from the room. He is now being investigated for drug trafficking and may face the death penalty if convicted.
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director of CNB said, “I want to commend my officers for their hard work and perseverance over the intense 48 hours period. This is a strong signal to drug abusers and pushers that we have zero tolerance towards drug abuse and CNB will not let up in our efforts to keep Singapore safe from drugs.”

Areas raided by CNB officers covered various part of Singapore including Ang Mo Kio, Balam Road, Balestier, Bishan, Bukit Batok, Circuit Road, Joo Chiat and North Bridge Road. A total of about 500 grammes of cannabis, 65 grammes of heroin, 63.65 grammes of Ice and 140 Erimin 5 and Ecstasy tablets, worth approximately $48,300, were seized. Raids at Circuit Road One of the cases in the 48-hour operation illustrated the wide sphere of the harmful influence of drugs. In the early afternoon on 8 Feb 2012, CNB officers staked out the HDB unit of a suspected heroin trafficker in the vicinity of Circuit Road. The officers eventually saw two male Singaporeans, one aged 58 years and the other, 32 years, leaving the HDB unit. At about 2.30pm, the officers moved in to arrest them and found the 32-year-old with one straw of heroin kept in a cigarette packet, inside his Bermudas pocket. CNB officers then moved in to raid the HDB unit, and arrested another 46-year-old Singaporean woman inside it. A search of the woman uncovered a yellow pouch in her pants’ pocket, and it was found to contain six straws of heroin and several empty straws. Preliminary investigations revealed that the 58-year-old man was her heroin supplier and she was peddling the drugs to others, including the 32-year-old man. CNB officers followed up with an operation the very same day to seek out more of the woman’s drug clients. At about 10pm, officers raided a HDB unit at nearby Balam Road and arrested a 43-year-old suspected drug abuser. The 58-year old man and 46-year-old woman will be investigated for drug trafficking while the 32-year-old and 43-year-old men will be investigated for drug consumption. Drug Trafficker Arrested at Joo Chiat Hotel In another case on 9 Feb 2012 at around 1pm, CNB officers arrested a 27-year-old male Malaysian on suspicion of drug trafficking in a Joo Chiat hotel room. The unemployed man was believed to be distributing drugs from the hotel room, and would move from hotel to hotel to evade arrest.  It was suspected that he had just received a new consignment of drugs and was planning to redistribute it onto the streets. An assortment of drugs and drug utensils were found in the room. In total, about 500 grammes of cannabis, 63 grammes of Ice, 100 Erimin 5 tablets and 40 Ecstasy tablets, worth more than S$37,600, were recovered from the room. He is now being investigated for drug trafficking and may face the death penalty if convicted. Mr Ng Ser Song, Director of CNB said, “I want to commend my officers for their hard work and perseverance over the intense 48 hours period. This is a strong signal to drug abusers and pushers that we have zero tolerance towards drug abuse and CNB will not let up in our efforts to keep Singapore safe from drugs.” Central Narcotics Bureau

A total haul of about 3.4kg of heroin, 1kg of ketamine and 5,000 Erimin-5 tablets were seized, estimated to be worth approximately S$590,000.
Dismantling of a Drug Syndicate
On 18 January 2012, CNB conducted investigations into a major drug trafficking syndicate which had sought to stock-up sizeable amounts of heroin, to take advantage of the coming long-weekend of festivities. The syndicate is suspected to be distributing heroin over various part of Singapore.
At about 2pm on 18 Jan 2012, two suspected drug traffickers from the syndicate, male Singaporeans aged 36 years and 53 years, were spotted in a silver-coloured car in Ang Mo Kio. CNB officers tailed them to Serangoon North, where the 53-year-old suspect was seen alighting with a black sling bag at the entrance of a carpark. When the officers moved in to arrest him, he attempted to flee but he was successfully apprehended after a short chase. One big bundle wrapped in black tape was found in the black sling bag and this was later found to contain approximately 920 grammes of heroin, estimated to be worth S$138,000. Meanwhile, CNB officers also moved in to arrest the 36-year-old suspect at another part of the carpark. The drug suspect struggled violently and resisted arrest but he was eventually subdued by the officers.
Cash amounting to about S$6,580 was also recovered from the two suspected drug traffickers. They will be investigated for drug trafficking.  If convicted, they may face the death penalty.
Earlier, on 14 January 2012, CNB had arrested another male Singaporean who is suspected to be a member of the same syndicate, and believed to be distributing large amounts of heroin.  This male drug trafficker was arrested with approximately 2,440 grammes of heroin, estimated to be worth approximately S$366,000.  He is being remanded for further investigation. If convicted, he may face the death penalty.
Large haul of ketamine and Erimin-5 intercepted at Woodlands Checkpoint
Separately in the evening of 17 January 2012, a male Singaporean driving a Singapore-registered car was stopped as part of a routine search by enforcement agencies stationed at the Woodlands Checkpoint.
Prior to searching the vehicle, CNB officers conducted a routine questioning of the driver and noticed that he appeared somewhat nervous.  Sensing the possibility that something was amiss, the officers then proceeded to conduct a thorough search of the vehicle and recovered about 5,000 Erimin-5 tablets hidden underneath a cushioned seat cover on the front passenger seat. Another approximately 1kg of ketamine was recovered from the rear pocket of the front passenger seat. The drugs seized from the vehicle are estimated to be worth almost S$85,000.
The male Singaporean is being investigated for the offence of importation of controlled drugs.  If convicted, he may face a maximum of 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane.
In the run-up to a long-weekend of festive celebration, CNB will continue with its intensive enforcement efforts, both inland and at the checkpoints, to keep Singapore safe from illicit drugs.

On 5 January 2012, at about ten pm, at the arrival bus concourse, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) was alerted that a male bus driver had found three black bundles hidden in one of the seats of the Malaysian-registered bus. The bus driver, 31, was earlier alerted by 2 passengers that they had noticed a fellow male passenger behaving suspiciously by pressing one of the seats in the bus that they were travelling together in. The bus driver then decided to conduct a check upon reaching Woodlands Checkpoint.
ICA officers quickly detained the 34-year-old Malaysian male suspect and informed the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) Enforcement Division’s duty team at the checkpoint. CNB officers conducted a further search on the bus and recovered another seven black bundles hidden in another seat on the same bus. The bundles are believed to contain heroin and in total, 17 packets concealed in 10 bundles of the drug, weighing approximately 4.9kg, were recovered. SPF K9 unit was also activated to help in the search.
The case is now under investigation. Anyone found guilty of importing more than 15 grammes nett of diamorphine may face the death sentence, if convicted.
Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security.  The enhanced security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  We have tightened our security checks on passengers, vehicles and conveyances at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands. In this case, thanks to the alertness of the two passengers, a nefarious attempt to smuggle in the large quantity of drugs was successfully prevented, which would have caused untold harm to our society if allowed to slip in into Singapore.

Another party of officers apprehended the 48-year-old Singaporean in the vicinity of Upper Paya Lebar, and recovered about 900g of heroin from him.  The man was brought back to his hideout at Kitchener Road and a subsequent search of the hideout recovered about 300g of heroin. All four males are being investigated for drug trafficking.  If convicted, they may face the death penalty.

Four suspected drug traffickers were arrested in the operation.
CNB officers were on the look-out for the two suspected foreign drug traffickers, who were believed to be distributing heroin consignments to local drug traffickers.
At about 8.30am on 26 Jun 2013, one of the suspects, a 37-year-old who was driving a Malaysian-registered lorry, stopped along Admiralty Road.  A second suspect, a 48-year-old male, approached the lorry from the passenger side of the lorry. He was seen retrieving a plastic bag from the passenger side of the lorry and he departed thereafter.  The first suspect drove his lorry off after this transaction.
In the meantime, the second suspect, met up with another male, a 47-year-old. Both Singaporean males were arrested by CNB officers shortly after in Marsiling. The 48-year-old suspect threw a plastic bag into the drain beside the pavement as the CNB officers closed in. The plastic bag was quickly recovered by CNB officers and it was found to contain about 730 grammes of heroin.
Meanwhile, CNB officers followed the lorry to Clementi Loop, where officers arrested the 37-year-old Malaysian driver after he alighted from the lorry. Another about 490 grammes of heroin were recovered from his lorry. At about 9am the same day, CNB officers arrested the fourth suspect, a Malaysian aged 35, who was meeting up with the 37-year-old driver.  The fourth suspect was also driving a Malaysian-registered lorry. More than 960 grammes of heroin were found in the fourth suspect’s lorry.
In total, about 2.1kg of heroin were seized in this single operation. The street value of the drugs was estimated to be at S$230,000. All four males are being investigated for drug trafficking.
This operation is another of CNB’s intensive and vigorous enforcement effort to weed out drug traffickers and curb the supply of drugs in Singapore. CNB will continue with its vigorous enforcement action against illicit drug activities to maintain a strong deterrent presence against both drug traffickers and abusers alike.

Finalists to dance against drugs at the Grand Finals
After months of intensive training and weeks of grueling competition, 12 finalist teams across Categories II and III emerged from 42 teams that competed at the preliminary rounds held on 2 and 9 March 2013, at the VivoCity Amphitheatre and Bugis+ Level
2 Atrium, respectively.
The six Category II finalist teams hail from Anglo-Chinese School (Barker), Juying Secondary School, North Vista Secondary School, Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School, Tanglin Secondary School and Temasek Secondary School. One of the six Category III finalist
teams is from Nanyang Junior College, while the other five are non school-based teams. Please refer to Annexes A-1 to A-12 for a brief profile of the 12 finalist teams.
The teams will be assessed based on their ingenuity in delivering an anti-drug message through their dance performances, in accordance to the theme “Live It Loud. Choreograph Your Life!” at the Grand Finals and stand to win cash prizes totaling
$36,000. The event will be hosted by Mr Divian Nair and Ms Chew Soo Wei, and will be graced by Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State (SMS), Ministry of Law and Ministry of Education, as the Guest-of-Honour. Please refer to Annex B  for the programme.
The audience can expect to be wowed at the Grand Finals by the finalist teams pitting their dance skills against one another to vie for the championships. Mr Eden Ang, who has been judging DanceWorks! since 2011, said that he was pleased to see a constant
high benchmark in the competition, and would like to see a “clear and honest message” portrayed by the dancers in their own interpretation of the theme. He is also looking forward to seeing “great skills” that tell “great
stories”. Ms Kay Lee, who has been judging the competition since 2008, finds fulfillment in watching DanceWorks! participants grow over the years. “This goes beyond just a dance competition, it’s also about nurturing young talents,”
said Kay.
Mass Dance as New Tradition of DanceWorks!
In celebration of its 15th anniversary, DanceWorks! has started a new mass dance tradition this year. Choreographed by Kay who is also a seasoned dance instructor, the mass dance had been taught to all participants and supporters at the earlier
rounds of the competition. To her, it was an honour to create the first DanceWorks! mass dance. “The steps were created to be fun and easy so that anyone and everyone can participate. It also allows experienced dancers to add their own flavour
and style or what they call ‘swag’ to the basic steps,” said Kay of her concept for the mass dance.
Kelvin Chandraatmadja, the team leader of Tanglin Motley Crew, said that he enjoyed the mass dance, which also allowed his non-dancer friends and supporters to pick up the steps and dance along. The team leader of KoolKatz, Tan Jia Hui,
felt that the mass dance was fun and engaging, and hyped up the event’s atmosphere, giving credit to the passionate mass dance instructors on stage.
“It was such a humble feeling to see hundreds of people learning the steps at various venues and enjoying themselves. And that everyone was so willing to be part of this event,” said Kay. The mass dance routine will be recapped and taught
again to the participants and supporters at the Grand Finals, and be carried forward as a tradition in future years of DanceWorks!.
“Live It Loud” the drug-free way through dance
Co-organised by the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) since 1999, DanceWorks! is the only nationwide dance competition with an anti-drug theme. To date, the competition has attracted participation from

 DanceWorks! 2013 celebrates 15 years of dancing against drugs with a grand finale at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza on 6 April 2013, when 12 teams will compete for the championships in the only nationwide anti-drug dance competition. Finalists to dance against drugs at the Grand Finals After months of intensive training and weeks of grueling competition, 12 finalist teams across Categories II and III emerged from 42 teams that competed at the preliminary rounds held on 2 and 9 March 2013, at the VivoCity Amphitheatre and Bugis+ Level
2 Atrium, respectively. The six Category II finalist teams hail from Anglo-Chinese School (Barker), Juying Secondary School, North Vista Secondary School, Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School, Tanglin Secondary School and Temasek Secondary School. One of the six Category III finalist
teams is from Nanyang Junior College, while the other five are non school-based teams. Please refer to Annexes A-1 to A-12 for a brief profile of the 12 finalist teams. The teams will be assessed based on their ingenuity in delivering an anti-drug message through their dance performances, in accordance to the theme “Live It Loud. Choreograph Your Life!” at the Grand Finals and stand to win cash prizes totaling
$36,000. The event will be hosted by Mr Divian Nair and Ms Chew Soo Wei, and will be graced by Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State (SMS), Ministry of Law and Ministry of Education, as the Guest-of-Honour. Please refer to Annex B  for the programme. The audience can expect to be wowed at the Grand Finals by the finalist teams pitting their dance skills against one another to vie for the championships. Mr Eden Ang, who has been judging DanceWorks! since 2011, said that he was pleased to see a constant
high benchmark in the competition, and would like to see a “clear and honest message” portrayed by the dancers in their own interpretation of the theme. He is also looking forward to seeing “great skills” that tell “great
stories”. Ms Kay Lee, who has been judging the competition since 2008, finds fulfillment in watching DanceWorks! participants grow over the years. “This goes beyond just a dance competition, it’s also about nurturing young talents,”
said Kay. Mass Dance as New Tradition of DanceWorks! In celebration of its 15th anniversary, DanceWorks! has started a new mass dance tradition this year. Choreographed by Kay who is also a seasoned dance instructor, the mass dance had been taught to all participants and supporters at the earlier
rounds of the competition. To her, it was an honour to create the first DanceWorks! mass dance. “The steps were created to be fun and easy so that anyone and everyone can participate. It also allows experienced dancers to add their own flavour
and style or what they call ‘swag’ to the basic steps,” said Kay of her concept for the mass dance. Kelvin Chandraatmadja, the team leader of Tanglin Motley Crew, said that he enjoyed the mass dance, which also allowed his non-dancer friends and supporters to pick up the steps and dance along. The team leader of KoolKatz, Tan Jia Hui,
felt that the mass dance was fun and engaging, and hyped up the event’s atmosphere, giving credit to the passionate mass dance instructors on stage. “It was such a humble feeling to see hundreds of people learning the steps at various venues and enjoying themselves. And that everyone was so willing to be part of this event,” said Kay. The mass dance routine will be recapped and taught
again to the participants and supporters at the Grand Finals, and be carried forward as a tradition in future years of DanceWorks!. “Live It Loud” the drug-free way through dance Co-organised by the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) since 1999, DanceWorks! is the only nationwide dance competition with an anti-drug theme.

On 4 March 2013, CNB officers who had been observing a couple suspected to be drug traffickers saw them meeting up with a man in the vicinity of a bus-stop along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4.  The couple parted ways with the man soon after.  The man, aged 47, was arrested for suspicion of drug consumption.
Another group of officers continued observation of the couple, who were spotted boarding a bus and subsequently alighting at a bus stop along Marymount Road.  Officers moved in to arrest the couple shortly after they alighted.  From the handbag of the 35-year-old woman, officers recovered about 46 grammes of heroin.  From the wallet of the 51-year-old man, officers found about 5 grammes of heroin.  Both are Singaporeans.
Further investigation revealed that the couple were staying at a hotel along Balestier Road.  Another about 15 grammes of heroin was subsequently recovered from the couple’s room.
The man is being investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, he may face a minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. The woman is being investigated for drug consumption.
This latest island-wide operation is part of CNB’s ongoing intensive enforcement efforts to remove illicit drug activities from the streets.  CNB will continue to mount island-wide operations to ensure that drug offenders are kept off the streets and not be allowed to carry out their unlawful activities.

 The relentless enforcement pressure on the ground continues.  Central Narcotics Bureau officers mounted a 48-hour island-wide operation from 4 to 6 March 2013.  The operation saw the arrest of 85 suspected drug offenders and seizure of drugs worth more than S$15,000.  Drugs seized included about 117 grammes of heroin, 14 grammes of ‘Ice’, 25 grammes of cannabis and a small amount of ketamine.  Officers from the Singapore Police Force also lent their support to CNB in this latest island-wide operation. The operation was conducted all across the island.  Areas covered included Ang Mo Kio, Bugis, Chai Chee, Henderson, and Geylang. Drug Offenders Mopped-up in central and northern Singapore On 4 March 2013, CNB Supervision ‘A’ Division and the Singapore Police Force ‘A’ Division jointly carried out wide-area anti-drug rounds in their jurisdiction, targeting areas such as Bendemeer, Beach Road, Jalan Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah. Separately, on 4 March 2013, CNB Supervision ‘J’ Division and the Singapore Police Force ‘J’ Division also jointly carried out anti-drug rounds in their jurisdiction. Targeted areas included Woodlands Centre Road, Boon Lay, Jurong West and Bukit Batok. During the anti-drug rounds at HDB units at Beach Road, CNB officers arrested two suspected drug abusers, a 58-year-old man and a 51-year-old woman, both Singaporeans.  Various drug paraphernalia, including drug-taking utensils, were recovered from within the HDB unit where both suspects were in.

81,Celebrating 15 years of dancing against drugs,2013-02-22,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/celebrating-15-years-of-dancing-against-drugs," DanceWorks! 2013 celebrates 15 years of dancing against drugs. Co-organised by the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) since 1999, this annual nationwide dance competition has attracted participation from
nearly 16,000 youths under 25 years who believe in leading and spreading the word of an active drug-free lifestyle. 
15th Anniversary of DanceWorks!
First organised in 1999, DanceWorks! enjoys a loyal following amongst youth dance enthusiasts who return year-in and year-out to compete on the dance floor. This year, DanceWorks! will see close to 75 teams competing for the top spots and cash prizes
worth $60,000. Of these, 40 teams are participating in DanceWorks! for the first time. “Sanoras Magnificas” from Sembawang Secondary School explained that they joined DanceWorks! to “tell people that a drug-free lifestyle is cool and awesome”,
while “Moda”[1] said that “a fit, healthy body is the best fashion statement” and “why do drugs when you can dance?”.
To celebrate 15 years of dancing against drugs, DanceWorks! will be starting a new tradition this year by having a mass dance. Specially choreographed by Ms Kay Lee, an experienced dance instructor as well as one of the judges for DanceWorks! since 2008,
the mass dance will be taught to all participants and supporters at various rounds of the competition. The mass dance routine will be carried forward as a tradition in future DanceWorks![2]. Other firsts for DanceWorks! include riding on two new social
media platforms to engage the youths, including non-dancers: Instagram and the blogs of five popular youth bloggers. In conjunction with the dance competition, we are also organising two lucky draw contests: the ‘15-word collection’ on five
blogs where participants are required to ‘collect’ 15 words by reading five blog entries and submit them for a lucky draw; and the Instagram contest, where participants simply need to post and submit up to five photographs with the hashtag
‘#danceworks2013’ and mention the DanceWorks! Instagram account, ‘danceworks_liveitloud’. Winners will stand to win movie passes and Instax instant cameras. Collaboration with Singapore Polytechnic This year, NCADA
and CNB are collaborating with Singapore Polytechnic (SP) for the first time to organise DanceWorks!. With regard to the collaboration, Mr Lim Cher Yam, Senior Director, Architecture, Design & Environment Cluster said, “Singapore Polytechnic is proud to collaborate with the National Council Against Drug Abuse and the Central Narcotics Bureau for DanceWorks! 2013. This is a meaningful community outreach project for our students to be involved in as it encourages youths to take their stand against drugs and pursue a healthy lifestyle.”
The group of four SP students (Khor Qi Min, Choo Siok Hui, Su Yongwen and Eugene Lee Han Leong) who had a part in conceptualising the event are very excited and looking forward to the competition. One of the students, Yongwen said, “This event not only allows me to gain new knowledge and experience but also gives me an opportunity to contribute to the society by sending out an impactful anti-drug message which will hopefully reduce the number of drug abusers in Singapore.”  The Year 2 students are currently taking a Diploma in Integrated Events & Project Management at SP. They were already involved in conducting an earlier ‘DanceWords’ fringe activity at Cathay Cineleisure Orchard and Bugis+ over four weekends
in November and December last year. Youths were invited to participate in the activity by forming their own anti-drug messages from 15 placards. Photographs of the participants posing with their anti-drug messages were uploaded on CNB’s ‘Live
It Loud’ Facebook page. The SP students will be at the competition rounds to help out in the event and to guide the participants and supporters for the mass dance.
Saying ‘NO’ to Drugs through Dance
One of the biggest dance competitions in Singapore, and the only one with an anti-drug theme, DanceWorks! aims to let participants have fun while internalising and sharing the anti-drug message. With this in mind, demonstration of the anti-drug theme
in the dance performance is a compulsory judging criterion which takes up 40% of the overall score. To further emphasise the importance of the anti-drug theme this year, the team that scores the highest for the anti-drug criterion will be presented
with a new “Best Anti-Drug Theme Award”. DanceWorks! 2013 performances will be judged by experienced professionals from the dance and artistic fields, with participants standing to win $60,000 in cash and other prizes.
Mr Victor Lye, Chairman, NCADA said, “For the past 14 years, we have been sending a strong message to youths on our zero-tolerance stance against drug abuse through DanceWorks!. As we celebrate the 15th anniversary of DanceWorks! this year, we are grateful to all those who have shared in this journey – as participants, sponsors and organisers. Danceworks! will continue to be a platform for youth to express themselves in Dance and to promote our anti-drug message among their peers. The Council will continue to work closely with CNB and the relevant community partners to organise creative and interesting outreach programmes to educate the youths and community groups on the dangers of drug abuse.”
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, CNB added, “DanceWorks! has been a platform for youths to showcase their talents while demonstrating to fellow youths how they can lead a healthy and drug-free lifestyle.  Over the past 14 years, we are repeatedly impressed by the standard of dance performances put up by participating teams and their creativity in weaving the anti-drug message in their performances. It is the belief and support that youths have in this event that makes it possible for us to celebrate this important milestone this year. We hope to continue organising the dance competition so that more youths are given a stage to unleash their talents and become our ambassadors to spread the anti-drug message”.

Part of ongoing collaboration between the two Home Team Departments, the joint Anti-Drug and Anti-Crime operation saw the deployment of more than 200 officers from both Home Team Departments. The officers swept several hotspots and haunts for drug offenders. During the operation, checks were conducted on more than 460 persons. 87 subjects were arrested for drug-related offences, and 5 other subjects were arrested for other offences like Immigration, suspected involvement in gang-related activities and working without work permit.
The operation was conducted at various locations including Aljunied, Bedok, Chai Chee, Eunos, Geylang Serai, Joo Chiat, Marine Parade, Pasir Ris, Tampines, Simei, and Upper Boon Keng. The officers swept the streets, and conducted intensive checks at the bus interchange, MRT stations, hawker centres, coffeeshops, wet-markets and void decks. This joint operation together with another operation conducted by CNB in the vicinity of Changi Road netted a total drug seizure of approximately 300g of Ice and about 1.2kg of heroin worth more than $180,000.
Drug seizure at Mountbatten
The officers were deployed to cover various areas during the joint operation. One team of officers who were deployed to the Mountbatten area raided a hotel room within the vicinity.  Approximately 146g of Ice with a street value of more than $23,000 and various drug paraphernalia were seized and officers arrested a 34-year-old male Singaporean.
The 34-year-old is being investigated for drug trafficking.
Six Arrested for Unlawful Society
Another group of officers who were deployed to the Geylang area nabbed 6 subjects under the Unlawful Society Act. Investigations against them are ongoing. Under Chapter 311 Section 14 (3) of the Societies Act, any person who is or acts as a member of an unlawful society, or attends a meeting of an unlawful society, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.
Partnership with the Home Team
Director Supervision of CNB, Mr Sng Chern Hong said, “Officers from both the Home Team Departments worked as a team to carry out this joint operation. This is a good demonstration of the cooperation and spirit between the Home Team agencies. We will continue to work relentlessly and stamp out any illicit drug activities in Singapore.”
Commander of Bedok Police Division, Mr How Kwang Wee commended the officers from both Home Team departments for the successful joint operations. He also added that the Police is determined to weed out all forms of criminal activity in Eastern Singapore and will be stepping up our efforts to ensure a safe and secure environment.
Separate CNB operation at Changi Road Netted more than 1.1kg of Heroin and 150g of ‘Ice’
In a separate CNB operation on 20 February 2013 in the Changi Road area, CNB officers spotted a suspected drug trafficker meeting up with a suspected drug courier. After they parted ways, officers arrested the 43-year-old suspected drug trafficker and recovered a bundle containing approximately 250g of granular substances believed to be heroin from the Singaporean.
Officers proceeded to arrest the 28-year-old suspected Malaysian drug courier along Chin Cheng Road and seized 3 more bundles of heroin, with a total weight of about 940g, six packets of ’Ice’ weighing about 153g and $5,920 in cash from him. Following up on this arrest, CNB officers arrested another drug trafficker suspected to be linked to the drug courier, a 28-year-old male Singapore at the vicinity of Kembangan MRT station. A total of $15,250 cash was recovered from him and the subsequent raid in his residence.
In total, this operation saw the seizure of drugs with a street worth of about $150,000. All the three men are investigated for drug trafficking.

In the morning of Chinese New Year’s Eve 9 Feb 2013, with the assistance of ICA officers, CNB arrested three suspected drug couriers in an anti-drug blitz within half an hour, seizing 1.5kg of heroin and about 325g of Ice worth about S$210,500.
For the first case, a 21-year-old Malaysian courier was stopped by ICA officers at the Woodlands Checkpoint motorcycle arrival area at about 3.55am. A search was conducted on him by CNB officers and they found a bundle containing heroin, weighing about 250g, from his underwear.
For the second case, at about 4.15am, CNB officers found three black bundles of drugs weighing about 830g from the front fender area beneath the headlight of the motorcycle. There were about 505g heroin and 325g Ice in the bundles. The 22-year-old courier from Malaysia was immediately arrested.
The officers rounded up their haul with the arrest of a third Malaysian courier, 19, at about 4.20am. ICA officers recovered three bundles of heroin, weighing approximately 750g, from the left fairing of the motorcycle.
The total street value of the 1.5kg heroin and 325g Ice seized was about S$210,500.
Investigations are on-going. All are being investigated for drug importation.
Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security. The enhanced security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  ICA have tightened its security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.
Director CNB, Mr Ng Ser Song, thanked all the officers involved in this anti-drug blitz for their hard work and said, “These arrests will send a strong signal to the syndicates out there who think they can try to smuggle drugs into Singapore during the festive period. They are sorely mistaken as CNB is not letting down our vigorous enforcement action against illicit drug activities at all times.”

84,Central Narcotics Bureau Drug Situation Report 2012: CNB's intensified enforcement efforts in 2012 see increase in drug abusers arrested and drugs seized,2013-02-04,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/central-narcotics-bureau-drug-situation-report-2012-cnb's-intensified-enforcement-efforts-in-2012-see-increase-in-drug-abusers-arrested-and-drugs-seized," The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested 3,507 drug abusers in 2012, an increase of 5% from the 3,326 drug abusers arrested in 2011.
In 2012, repeat abusers continued to form the majority of abusers arrested at 69%.  The 2,415 repeat abusers arrested in 2012 represent an increase of 10% from 2011.
On the other hand, the number of new abusers arrested dropped 3% to 1,092.  Nevertheless, the proportion of new abusers still makes up 31% of the total number of drug abusers arrested.  This remains a concern for CNB as 68% of the new abusers arrested are 29 years old and below.  Amongst new abusers arrested, new youth abusers below the age of 20 dropped 29% to 162 arrests in 2012.
Heroin and methamphetamine remain the most commonly abused drugs – about 93% of all drug abusers arrested abused either heroin or methamphetamine.
Stemming the supply of drugs from making its way into Singapore and intensive enforcement efforts inland remain key priorities for CNB.  In 2012, CNB conducted 49 major operations, dismantling 22 drug syndicates.  The intensive all-round enforcement efforts saw a record seizure of drugs in 2012.  The estimated street value of the drugs seized in 2012 amounted to S$18.3 million, 14% higher than the estimated S$16 million in 2011.  In particular, CNB seized a record 50.84kg of crystal methamphetamine (‘Ice’) in 2012, of which, about 43kg or 85% of it was not intended for the local market.
CNB also did not let up on the preventive drug education (PDE) front.  In 2012, ‘DanceWorks!’, the flagship event of the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign, entered its 14th year.  Together with many other PDE events year-round, CNB aims to reach out to more youths and inculcate in them the zero-tolerance approach towards drugs and drug abuse.
The 2012 drug statistics are set against the backdrop of a worsening regional drug situation.  Drug production figures in the region continue to set record highs and international syndicates have also made inroads into the region, even as regional countries continue to seek enforcement efforts against the drug scourge.
CNB will continue with its intensive enforcement efforts targeting both the supply and demand side of the drug problem.  The amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act, which includes enhanced penalties for drug traffickers targeting young persons and recalcitrant drug traffickers, as well as the temporary listing of possible new substances of abuse, will further strengthen CNB’s ability to fight against the drug scourge.
Beyond prevention and enforcement, the new measures that will be introduced in the rehabilitation and aftercare of drug abusers, such as the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS), will help CNB to control the local drug situation.

“To prevent drug contamination from taking hold on the ground, the Central Narcotics Bureau has been keeping up with our intensive enforcement efforts, both inland and at the checkpoints, to remove drug abusers and peddlers alike from the streets as early as possible. 2012 saw an increase in the number of drug abusers arrested and drugs seized. This is an ongoing battle.
The regional drug situation remains unfavourable, with no signs that regional drug production will ease off. Methamphetamine production in the East and Southeast Asia region continue to set record highs, as with poppy cultivation. If left unchecked, all these drugs will flow throughout the region and destroy many.
To the drug syndicates out there who may entertain the idea of making use of Singapore’s excellent transport connectivity to ship drugs through Singapore, they are sorely mistaken. CNB will continue to work closely with our counterparts to hit them hard and deter them from doing so.”

Director, Central Narcotics Bureau The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested 3,507 drug abusers in 2012, an increase of 5% from the 3,326 drug abusers arrested in 2011. In 2012, repeat abusers continued to form the majority of abusers arrested at 69%.  The 2,415 repeat abusers arrested in 2012 represent an increase of 10% from 2011. On the other hand, the number of new abusers arrested dropped 3% to 1,092.  Nevertheless, the proportion of new abusers still makes up 31% of the total number of drug abusers arrested.  This remains a concern for CNB as 68% of the new abusers arrested are 29 years old and below.  Amongst new abusers arrested, new youth abusers below the age of 20 dropped 29% to 162 arrests in 2012. Heroin and methamphetamine remain the most commonly abused drugs – about 93% of all drug abusers arrested abused either heroin or methamphetamine. Stemming the supply of drugs from making its way into Singapore and intensive enforcement efforts inland remain key priorities for CNB.  In 2012, CNB conducted 49 major operations, dismantling 22 drug syndicates.  The intensive all-round enforcement efforts saw a record seizure of drugs in 2012.  The estimated street value of the drugs seized in 2012 amounted to S$18.3 million, 14% higher than the estimated S$16 million in 2011.  In particular, CNB seized a record 50.84kg of crystal methamphetamine (‘Ice’) in 2012, of which, about 43kg or 85% of it was not intended for the local market. CNB also did not let up on the preventive drug education (PDE) front.  In 2012, ‘DanceWorks!’, the flagship event of the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign, entered its 14th year.  Together with many other PDE events year-round, CNB aims to reach out to more youths and inculcate in them the zero-tolerance approach towards drugs and drug abuse. The 2012 drug statistics are set against the backdrop of a worsening regional drug situation.  Drug production figures in the region continue to set record highs and international syndicates have also made inroads into the region, even as regional countries continue to seek enforcement efforts against the drug scourge.

CNB officers, in a follow-up operation, nabbed the two local drug traffickers, suspected to be responsible for the consignment, and seized a further small amount of heroin and “Ice”.
First detection at Tuas Checkpoint
On 3 January 2013 at about 0720hrs, ICA officers stopped a 28-year-old male motorcyclist for thorough checks at the motorcycle arrival lane of Tuas checkpoint. The alert ICA officers detected one black bundle hidden below the headlight of the motorcycle, and they immediately notified CNB officers as the bundle was believed to contain controlled drugs.
CNB officers who attended to the case conducted a further search of the Malaysian-registered motorcycle and found four more black bundles below the right and left fairings of the motorcycle. In all, the bundles were found to contain heroin of about 1.4kg. The Malaysian was immediately placed under arrest.
Swift follow-up operation at inland Singapore
CNB officers swiftly conducted a follow-up operation to round up the recipients of the drug delivery. At about 1430hrs the same day, CNB officers arrested two male Singaporeans, aged 47 and 64 respectively, in a Singapore-registered car in the vicinity of Woodlands Street 32. Another 85 straws of heroin, weighing about 115 grammes, a small packet of ‘Ice’, drug paraphernalia, more than S$5,000 cash, and two flick knives were recovered from the car. The operation continued till the early hours of 4 January 2013, with one more packet of heroin, weighing about 8 grammes, found in another car in the same vicinity. The two flick knives were referred to Police for further investigation.
Police K-9 unit was also deployed to search the three vehicles.
In all, the two related operations saw a total seizure of about 1.5kg of heroin and 0.4g of ‘Ice’ with an estimated street value of approximately S$160,000.
The 47-year-old and 64-year-old Singaporeans are being investigated for drug trafficking while the 28-year-old Malaysian is being investigated for drug importation. If convicted, they may face the death penalty under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
Continued vigilance by the Home Team
Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security. The enhanced security checks are critical to our nation’s security. ICA have tightened its security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

 The close working relationship between the Home Team agencies was evident yet again when officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), with help from the Singapore Police Force (SPF)’s K-9 unit, seized about 1.4kg of heroin from a Malaysian drug courier at Tuas Checkpoint just three days into the new year. CNB officers, in a follow-up operation, nabbed the two local drug traffickers, suspected to be responsible for the consignment, and seized a further small amount of heroin and “Ice”. First detection at Tuas Checkpoint On 3 January 2013 at about 0720hrs, ICA officers stopped a 28-year-old male motorcyclist for thorough checks at the motorcycle arrival lane of Tuas checkpoint. The alert ICA officers detected one black bundle hidden below the headlight of the motorcycle, and they immediately notified CNB officers as the bundle was believed to contain controlled drugs. CNB officers who attended to the case conducted a further search of the Malaysian-registered motorcycle and found four more black bundles below the right and left fairings of the motorcycle. In all, the bundles were found to contain heroin of about 1.4kg. The Malaysian was immediately placed under arrest. Swift follow-up operation at inland Singapore CNB officers swiftly conducted a follow-up operation to round up the recipients of the drug delivery. At about 1430hrs the same day, CNB officers arrested two male Singaporeans, aged 47 and 64 respectively, in a Singapore-registered car in the vicinity of Woodlands Street 32. Another 85 straws of heroin, weighing about 115 grammes, a small packet of ‘Ice’, drug paraphernalia, more than S$5,000 cash, and two flick knives were recovered from the car. The operation continued till the early hours of 4 January 2013, with one more packet of heroin, weighing about 8 grammes, found in another car in the same vicinity. The two flick knives were referred to Police for further investigation. Police K-9 unit was also deployed to search the three vehicles. In all, the two related operations saw a total seizure of about 1.5kg of heroin and 0.4g of ‘Ice’ with an estimated street value of approximately S$160,000. The 47-year-old and 64-year-old Singaporeans are being investigated for drug trafficking while the 28-year-old Malaysian is being investigated for drug importation. If convicted, they may face the death penalty under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Continued vigilance by the Home Team Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security. The enhanced security checks are critical to our nation’s security. ICA have tightened its security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

From these two operations, a total of about
2.6kg of heroin and 1.2kg of cannabis were seized. The seized drugs had an estimated street value of more than S$226,000.
Cannabis trafficker arrested in Marsiling
On the morning of 14 October 2014, CNB officers deployed in the vicinity of a housing block at Marsiling Drive spotted the 46-year-old male suspected cannabis trafficker meeting up with a 40-year-old male suspected drug client. They parted ways after
a short while and officers moved in and placed both under arrest. CNB officers recovered about 40g of cannabis from the 40-year-old male and about 260g of cannabis from the 46-year-old male.
The 46-year-old suspected drug trafficker was brought back to his residence at a housing block in the vicinity. About 960g of cannabis and a small amount of ‘Ice’ and heroin were recovered from within the unit.
Heroin distributor surprised at Clementi
On the same day in the early afternoon, another party of CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of a housing block at Clementi West Street 1 with a view to arresting a 40-year-old suspected heroin trafficker. He was believed to be dealing in sizeable
amounts of heroin. CNB officers spotted the suspected heroin trafficker getting on board a van driven by another suspect, a 48-year-old male. CNB officers stopped the van at the exit of the carpark and swiftly placed both men under arrest.
CNB officers conducted a search of the van and recovered about 2.6kg of heroin from within the vehicle. Drug paraphernalia such as digital weighing scale and empty plastic sachets were also recovered from within the van. Cash of more than S$6,700 was
found on the 40-year-old suspected trafficker.
Investigations into the drug activities of all four Singaporean suspects are ongoing. If convicted, they may face the death penalty. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds
15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis may face the death penalty.
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “The 2.6kg of heroin seized could have fed the addiction of almost 1250 drug abusers for a week, and the 1.2kg of cannabis seized could have been used to lure many unsuspecting new abusers into trying out drugs for the
first time, starting a vicious cycle of lifelong addiction, bringing upon families immense pain and suffering when they see their loved ones fighting to be free from drug addiction. CNB will not let up in our enforcement efforts and will not allow drugs
to enslave our community.”

This was the largest single haul of heroin this year so far.
On 23 Sept 2014, CNB launched an operation to dismantle a local drug syndicate which was believed to have been bringing in sizeable amount of drugs from a neighbouring country and distributing to the local market.
The operation was carried out at a commercial building in Geylang. At about 8.50pm, CNB officers arrested two Singaporean males aged 44 and 46 in their car parked in the commercial building’s compound. About 535g of heroin were recovered from the car and a small amount of Ice was recovered from the 46-year-old.
CNB officers raided an unit in the same commercial building; which was believed to be the syndicate’s hideout. More drugs, about 5.5kg of heroin, 1.3kg of cannabis, and other drugs including Ice, ecstasy, Erimin-5 tablets and more than S$12,000 were seized from the unit.
Another about 460g of heroin were found in the 44-year-old male’s residence at Jalan Kayu.
In total, about 6.5kg of heroin, 1.3kg of cannabis, small amounts of other drugs and more than S$12,000 were seized in the entire operation. The drugs have a street value of about S$506,000.
Investigations are ongoing. If convicted, the two men may face the death penalty. 
Dir CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “The large amount of heroin seized could potentially feed the addiction of about 3125 heroin abusers for a week. CNB will continue to clamp down on drug traffickers and syndicates to stop the drugs from flowing onto Singapore’s streets. Let this be a warning to the drug syndicates out there that Singapore will not tolerate any illicit drug activities.”

On 26 August 2014, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) launched an operation to apprehend a suspected drug syndicate leader who was believed to be distributing sizeable amounts of cannabis and heroin to local drug traffickers.  From this operation, a total of about 2,625g of cannabis and 232g of heroin were seized.  The drugs seized had a total street value of more than S$103,000.
On 26 August 2014, at around 11.30 am, CNB officers deployed in the vicinity of Woodlands Avenue 1 spotted the syndicate leader meeting up with a suspected drug trafficker.  They parted ways soon after and officers moved in swiftly and placed both under arrest.  From the 49-year-old suspected drug trafficker, CNB officers recovered a total of about 415g of cannabis.
After he was arrested, the 51-year-old syndicate leader was brought to Woodlands Avenue 1, where he was believed to have hidden more drugs.  About 2,210g of cannabis and 232g of heroin were recovered in the various hideouts. 
CNB officers then proceeded to the official residence of the 49-year-old suspected trafficker, where a search of the unit found a small amount of ‘Ice’ and various improvised drug smoking apparatus.  A 54-year-old suspected drug abuser was arrested within the unit, and a 55-year-old suspected drug abuser was arrested just as he was approaching the unit.  All the suspects arrested are male Singaporeans.
Investigations on all the suspects are ongoing.  Any person convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis will face the death penalty.
Arrest of another group of youth abusers
Separately, on 24 August 2014, police officers placed under arrest four youths in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 after one of the youths was found in possession of a small packet of ‘Ice’.  The youths were aged between 14 to 17 years of age.  All are Singaporeans and one is a female.
CNB conducted follow-up investigations on the same day and arrested two suspected drug traffickers aged 24 and 32 in the vicinity of Hougang Avenue 2. They were suspected to have sold drugs to one of the youths arrested earlier.  Both are male Singaporeans.  From the bag of the 24-year-old, officers found two small packets of ‘Ice’.
CNB officers brought the 24-year-old suspect to his residence in Hougang and various drug-taking paraphernalia were recovered from his bedroom.
Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.  The 24-year-old male is being investigated for trafficking Class ‘A’ controlled drugs to a young person.  If convicted of trafficking Class ‘A’ controlled drugs to a young person, he faces the enhanced penalty of a minimum of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane.  Following new laws introduced in 2012, those convicted of trafficking to a young person below 21 years of age will face enhanced penalties.

CNB conducted follow-up investigations on the same day and arrested two suspected drug traffickers aged 24 and 32 in the vicinity of Hougang Avenue 2. They were suspected to have sold drugs to one of the youths arrested earlier.  Both are male Singaporeans.  From the bag of the 24-year-old, officers found two small packets of ‘Ice’. CNB officers brought the 24-year-old suspect to his residence in Hougang and various drug-taking paraphernalia were recovered from his bedroom. Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.  The 24-year-old male is being investigated for trafficking Class ‘A’ controlled drugs to a young person.  If convicted of trafficking Class ‘A’ controlled drugs to a young person, he faces the enhanced penalty of a minimum of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane.  Following new laws introduced in 2012, those convicted of trafficking to a young person below 21 years of age will face enhanced penalties. CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

Between January and June 2014, heroin and methamphetamine made up 93% of all drug abusers arrested and 5% of all drug abusers arrested abused cannabis, making it the third most commonly abused drug. This situation was similar to the same period in 2013.
Amongst new abusers, methamphetamine was the most commonly abused drug in the first half of 2014 (68% of the total), followed by heroin (15%) and cannabis (12%).  In the same period of 2013, 61% of new drug abusers abused methamphetamine, 23% abused heroin and 10% abused cannabis. About two-thirds (69%) of new drug abusers arrested in the first half of 2014 were below the age of 30. This was a four percentage point increase when compared to the first half of 2013.
Compared to the first half of 2013, the first half of 2014 saw an overall decrease in the seizure of drugs. The estimated street value of the total drugs seized amounted to about S$4.71 million, a decrease of 50% when compared to the first half of 2013. Seizures of heroin decreased by about 24%, from 35.94kg to 27.46kg. Seizures of methamphetamine or ‘Ice’ decreased by about 62%, from 22.49kg to 8.65kg. However, seizures of ‘Ice’ meant specifically for the local market increased about 10% from 4.82kg to 5.30kg.
Preventive Drug Education (PDE) remains a key approach in the Central Narcotics Bureau’s fight against drugs. To engage youths and the general public on the dangers of drug abuse, CNB continued to deliver anti-drugs talks and held exhibitions to schools for the first half of 2014 to drive the anti-drug message to the masses. Key outreach efforts included DanceWorks![1] 2014, an Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign[2] 2014 and the Singapore Games Creation Competition (SGCC) 2014[3]. Community partnership is also one of CNB’s approaches to include the larger community in the fight against drugs. CNB also collaborated with key stakeholders such as the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), Fei Yue Community Services, Beyond Social Services, Yayasan Mendaki, and 4PM (also known as the Malay Youth Literary Association) to deliver the anti-drug message at these community partners’ events.

In total, six suspects were arrested. CNB also seized about 3,041g heroin and 215g of Ice in the operation. The drugs had a total street value of more
than S$353,000. Officers from the Singapore Police Force (SPF) assisted in this operation.
In the operation, CNB targeted a 41-year-old male Singaporean, who was suspected to be heading a drug syndicate which was actively distributing heroin in the local market. The 41-year-old obtained his supplies from a neighbouring country.
On 24 July 2014 late afternoon, CNB arrested two male Malaysians, aged 21 and 33, in a taxi in the Woodlands vicinity. About 2,330g of heroin were recovered from under the front passenger seat of the taxi. S$15,000 in cash was also recovered from one
of the Malaysians. At about the same time, CNB and SPF officers arrested another 34-year-old Singapore male, a suspected drug trafficker, who was driving along the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). The arrest, which was effected along the AYE, was done swiftly
and decisively, and the suspect’s vehicle was immediately shifted to a nearby location to minimise disruption to traffic and to ensure both the public’s and the officers’ safety.
In a follow-up raid, the 41-year-old was arrested at a housing block in the Admiralty vicinity. The 41-year-old and the 34-year-old Singaporeans were brought to their hideout in Geylang where CNB officers seized another about 709g of heroin and 215g of
Ice. A 21-year-old male and a 37-year-old female, both Singaporeans, were also arrested.
The 21-year-old male and the 37-year-old female are being investigated for drug consumption offence. The other four drug suspects are being investigated for drug trafficking. If convicted, they may face the death penalty. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides
for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “The operation is a testament of the Home Team’s close cooperation and our commitment to keep the streets of Singapore safe from drugs. I thank all the officers involved in the operation. CNB will continue to intensify

Both Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng were convicted of trafficking in a controlled drug and sentenced to death. Tang Hai Liang was found to have trafficked 89.55g of diamorphine and Foong Chee Peng was found to have trafficked 40.23g of diamorphine.

A thorough review of the mandatory death penalty in our laws was conducted from July 2011. A moratorium on executions was placed while the law was being reviewed. The changes to the mandatory death penalty regime were passed by Parliament in November 2012 after a full debate, and came into force in January 2013. All persons already sentenced to death under the Misuse of Drugs Act by the time the new legislation came into force were given the opportunity to elect to be considered for re-sentencing under the new regime.
Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng had been accorded full due process, including the opportunity to appeal to the Court of Appeal and to elect to be considered for re-sentencing under the new regime. Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng both appeared in person before an Assistant Registrar in the High Court to confirm that they did not wish to be part of the re-sentencing process, and that they understood the consequences of their respective decisions. Both of them were represented by counsel throughout the legal process, and were also given the opportunity to petition the President for Clemency. Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng both elected not to petition the President for Clemency. An unsigned petition for Clemency was subsequently submitted on Tang Hai Liang’s behalf. Tang Hai Liang indicated that he did not wish to appeal for Clemency and that the petition had been submitted by his family without his prior knowledge. This petition for Clemency was turned down and his family was informed of the decision.

The changes to the mandatory death penalty regime were passed by Parliament in November 2012 after a full debate, and came into force in January 2013. All persons already sentenced to death under the Misuse of Drugs Act by the time the new legislation came into force were given the opportunity to elect to be considered for re-sentencing under the new regime. Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng had been accorded full due process, including the opportunity to appeal to the Court of Appeal and to elect to be considered for re-sentencing under the new regime. Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng both appeared in person before an Assistant Registrar in the High Court to confirm that they did not wish to be part of the re-sentencing process, and that they understood the consequences of their respective decisions. Both of them were represented by counsel throughout the legal process, and were also given the opportunity to petition the President for Clemency. Tang Hai Liang and Foong Chee Peng both elected not to petition the President for Clemency. An unsigned petition for Clemency was subsequently submitted on Tang Hai Liang’s behalf. Tang Hai Liang indicated that he did not wish to appeal for Clemency and that the petition had been submitted by his family without his prior knowledge. This petition for Clemency was turned down and his family was informed of the decision. CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

Mr Daniel Tan, Director, SP, ABE said: “We are pleased to be working with CNB and NCADA on these two meaningful projects, which have seen many years of success in spreading the anti-drug message to the youth. The collaboration gives our students the unique opportunity for experiential learning where they can apply skills and knowledge in managing events. At the same time, they also learn to appreciate the importance of supporting the anti-drug cause”.
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director CNB added: “These collaborations are important as we are able to involve the community, especially the youths, in sharing about the serious consequences of drug abuse. We see great value in involving the youths themselves, as they know best what would resonate with their peers. We are very heartened to receive continued support from the schools and the community in our fight against drug abuse. We hope that in encouraging the youths to express themselves through a healthy lifestyle without drugs, we can ultimately influence a new generation of people who will continue to promulgate the zero tolerance approach in our society.”

Emphasising the important role that the community play in sustaining the anti-drug movement in Singapore, Mr Victor Lye, Chairman, NCADA, said “Drug abuse imposes a substantial burden on the society. It affects not only the abusers, but also the non-abusers. Beyond tough laws and intensive enforcement efforts, the society has a responsibility to protect our children from becoming victims of the drug menace. NCADA will continue to work with CNB and community partners to raise Singaporeans’ awareness on the dangers of drug abuse.”

In total, four were arrested and about 2.12kg of heroin, 216g of ‘Ice’ and 480 Erimin-5 tablets, worth more than S$252,000, were seized.
First operation
In the first operation, at about 6pm on 16 May 2014, CNB officers observed the meet-up between a suspected drug trafficker and a drug runner at a housing block in Ang Mo Kio Ave 4.  The runner, a female Singaporean aged 49, was arrested shortly after the meet-up at Ang Mo Kio St 61. Cash amounting to S$8,200 was found on her.
Another party of CNB officers immediately raided the unit of the same housing block where the meet-up had taken place. A 42-year-old male Singaporean was arrested inside the hideout. Follow-up search led to the recovery of two bundles of heroin inside the rubbish collection point on the ground floor for the suspected trafficker’s unit. The man had earlier torn open one of the bundles and had disposed both bundles down the rubbish chute. The drugs recovered were believed to be heroin weighing about 950g, with a street value of nearly S$100,000.
Second operation
On the same day 16 May 2014, at about 6.25pm, another group of CNB officers arrested two males who had just alighted from a maroon car at the vicinity of Geylang Lorong 33. The officers found a bundle of heroin weighing about 922g from the centre console box of the vehicle. Further raids at the two suspected drug offenders’ hideout at a condominium in the same vicinity yielded about 253.6g of heroin, 216.3g of ‘Ice’, 480 Erimin-5 tablets and S$4,500 cash.
The duo, both male Singaporeans, aged 56 and 57, had intended for the drugs to be distributed onto the streets of Singapore. The street value of the drugs seized in this Geylang operation was more than S$152,700.
The total amount of heroin seized from these two operations could sustain more than one thousand drug abusers for an entire week.

124,Listing of Fifth Schedule drugs to the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act with effect from 1 May 2014,2014-04-30,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/listing-of-fifth-schedule-drugs-to-the-first-schedule-of-the-misuse-of-drugs-act-with-effect-from-1-may-2014," With effect from 1 May 2014, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all the psychoactive substances currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), in the First Schedule of the same Act. This would mean that these substances would be re-classified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of Fifth Schedule drugs that will be shifted to the First Schedule).
At the same time, a new list of substances will be placed in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA. The new list of substances on the Fifth Schedule is at Annex B.
BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
New psychoactive substances (NPS) are today being developed very rapidly across the globe. The Fifth Schedule of the MDA was enacted on 1 May 2013 to allow CNB to control and prevent the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. The Fifth Schedule enables CNB to seize these NPS so that the circulation of such substances can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.  These processes are necessary before a substance is classified as a controlled drug. However, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of any substance which is temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule will not constitute an offence under the MDA, until that substance is removed from the Fifth Schedule and is subsequently listed as a controlled drug in the First Schedule whereupon all these offences will apply.
Most of these new psychoactive substances are produced by introducing slight modifications to the chemical structures of controlled drugs.  Many of these addictive substances have effects similar to other Class A drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, MDMA (‘Ecstasy’) and LSD (lysergamide); and their abuse have been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations, and even death. Based on the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug Report 2013, many NPS are being used as substitutes for controlled drugs, often being touted as “legal highs” that can be abused without fear of enforcement action. Many countries have also reported the emergence of NPS.
CNB has noted an increase in the number of NPS trafficking and abuse cases detected in the last year. CNB has also completed consultations with the Health Sciences Authority, research institutes and industry stakeholders and they have indicated that there are currently no known medical and industrial uses for these substances. Given these developments and the fact that these substances mimic the effects of harmful Class A drugs, CNB has decided to list all the Fifth Schedule drugs to the First Schedule of the MDA as Class A controlled drugs.
Following the listing of these NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA.  Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.  They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, CNB said, “The drug situation is challenging and the number of repeat drug abusers and young drug abusers remains a concern. With the abuse and trafficking of NPS on the rise, listing these new psychoactive substances as Class A controlled drugs signals our unequivocal stance that these substances are illegal and no different from other controlled drugs.”

The Media Development Authority (MDA) has directed the site owners to remove the website contents in their entirety by 19 February 2014. The website contains material that promotes or tends to promote the use of a prohibited substance.
The website undermines Singapore’s efforts in drug preventive education and erodes our society’s resilience against drug abuse. Singaporeans enjoy a safe and secure environment because of our firm stance against drugs and crime, and central to this is our “zero-tolerance” approach against the drug menace.
First-timers, and young persons in particular, can be misled into believing that such “gateway drugs” are acceptable, and be subsequently drawn into using even more dangerous drugs resulting in lifelong addiction. Drug abuse and addiction harms not only the abusers, but also leads to serious downstream problems for their families and loved ones.
The website also makes claims about the purported benefits of “medical cannabis”.  There have not been sufficient properly conducted and validated clinical trials to show that the purported benefits of this drug outweigh its risks. If anyone has such validated evidence, and wants to advocate for its medical use, they should submit the scientific evidence to the appropriate health authorities, who are in the best position to make a proper medical and scientific assessment, instead of promoting the use of a prohibited substance to the public.

In 2013, repeat abusers constituted 69% (or 2,471 arrests) of all abusers arrested.  This represented a 2% increase from 2012, where there were 2,415 arrests.
The number of new abusers arrested increased by 2%, from 1,092 in 2012 to 1,110 in 2013.  New abusers made up 31% of all abusers arrested.  About half of new abusers arrested are 20 to 29 years old. New youth abusers below the age of 20 decreased by 6% from 162 arrests in 2012 to 153 arrests in 2013.

In 2013, CNB conducted 46 major operations, including 19 island-wide operations, crippling 20 drug syndicates. The island-wide operations targeted middle-level traffickers, street-level pushers and drug abusers, and were strongly supported by the Singapore Police Force (SPF).
CNB’s intensive enforcement efforts saw an increased seizure of drugs in 2013.  The estimated street value of the drugs seized in 2013 amounted to S$20.5 million, 12% higher than the estimated S$18.3 million in 2012.  CNB seized 72.37kg of heroin in 2013, about 9% more than in 2012 (66.38kg). The quantity of ‘Ice” seized in 2013 remained high, at 44.06kg. Of the 44.06kg of ‘Ice’ seized in 2013, about 80%, or 35.21kg of it, was not intended for the local market.
On the preventive drug education (PDE) front, CNB continued to press on with our PDE efforts.  We continued to organise annual large-scale events such as ‘DanceWorks!’ and the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign to serve as public reminders of the anti-drug message. At the same time, CNB also widened our outreach to older youths and parents, to emphasise the anti-drug message and share the harmful effects of drugs and drug abuse.

Another three male suspected drug traffickers, one of whom is suspected to be the leader of the syndicate, were arrested in a follow-up operation in Singapore.
At about 8.10pm on 25 January 2014, officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) stopped a Malaysian-registered vehicle entering Singapore at the arrival car zone of Woodlands Checkpoint with two passengers and referred them to CNB for checks.
Two female CNB officers conducted a search on the female Malaysian passenger and found two bundles of heroin hidden in the 22-year-old’s underwear. In total, about 937 grams of heroin with a street value of about S$98,000 were recovered.
Following the arrest of the Malaysian woman, CNB officers swiftly conducted follow-up operations through the night. Their efforts led to the arrests of three male Singaporeans, aged between 44 to 57, in the vicinity of Telok Blangah Crescent and Pipit Road. The three men are suspected to be involved in coordinating and bringing drugs into Singapore before re-distributing them onto the streets. One of them is suspected to be the leader of the syndicate. Investigations are on-going.
This is another example of the close cooperation of the Home Team agencies at the checkpoints. CNB and the ICA will continue to work together to prevent attempts to smuggle illicit drugs into Singapore. The inflow of these illicit drugs into Singapore will cause untold harm to the society and the offenders behind these nefarious activities will be stopped.

 The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has arrested another female who tried to smuggle about 937 grams of heroin into Singapore on 25 January 2014. Another three male suspected drug traffickers, one of whom is suspected to be the leader of the syndicate, were arrested in a follow-up operation in Singapore. At about 8.10pm on 25 January 2014, officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) stopped a Malaysian-registered vehicle entering Singapore at the arrival car zone of Woodlands Checkpoint with two passengers and referred them to CNB for checks. Two female CNB officers conducted a search on the female Malaysian passenger and found two bundles of heroin hidden in the 22-year-old’s underwear. In total, about 937 grams of heroin with a street value of about S$98,000 were recovered. Following the arrest of the Malaysian woman, CNB officers swiftly conducted follow-up operations through the night. Their efforts led to the arrests of three male Singaporeans, aged between 44 to 57, in the vicinity of Telok Blangah Crescent and Pipit Road. The three men are suspected to be involved in coordinating and bringing drugs into Singapore before re-distributing them onto the streets. One of them is suspected to be the leader of the syndicate. Investigations are on-going. This is another example of the close cooperation of the Home Team agencies at the checkpoints. CNB and the ICA will continue to work together to prevent attempts to smuggle illicit drugs into Singapore. The inflow of these illicit drugs into Singapore will cause untold harm to the society and the offenders behind these nefarious activities will be stopped. CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

About National Council Against Drug Abuse
 
The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) was formed in January 1995 as an advisory council to the Minister and the Ministry of Home Affairs on policies and measures necessary to curb drug abuse in Singapore and to mobilise and sustain public support for the anti-drug programmes undertaken by government departments and voluntary organisations. Together with the Home Team departments, relevant agencies and community partners, NCADA organises and coordinates anti-drug activities as well as assists other organisations, institutions, bodies and persons who are interested in tackling the drug problem. NCADA also aims to promote preventive drug education programmes to educate the public on the drug menace and rally support for the government’s efforts against drug abuse.
 
About the Clubs Against Drugs Campaign
 
This will be the 15th year in which NCADA has organised the Clubs Against Drugs Campaign (CAD). The CAD Campaign was first launched in 2000 by the National Council Against Drug Abuse to address the possible issue of drug abuse in night entertainment outlets. Over the years, NCADA has forged a partnership with club operators to promote the anti-drug message to club patrons and to raise awareness of the dangers of drugs and the harsh penalties that come along with drug abuse and trafficking. Participating club and restaurant operators are offered tailored anti-drug talks to equip them with the skills to identify drug abusers on their premises. This year, ground outreach activities will also be organised to reach out to the patrons of clubs, pubs and restaurants to remind them on the importance of partying in a drug-free environment. There will be a total of 4 nights of ground outreach activities. YOLO. Get high on life, not drugs!”. With the festive season fast approaching, NCADA kicks off the campaign this year, with anti-drug ambassadors walking the ground in Clarke Quay and Boat Quay on 12 Dec 2015 & 17 -19 Dec to remind patrons of clubs and pubs that they can still have as much fun with a clean partying scene in a drug-free environment.            National Council Against Drug Abuse

In the evening of 8 December 2015, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Hamilton Road to conduct observation on a suspected drug syndicate leader, who was believed to be trafficking an assortment of drugs.  
At about 7.11pm, a rider of a Malaysia-registered motorcycle was spotted entering a unit along Hamilton Road.  At about 7.25pm, the rider was seen leaving the unit and subsequently left the area on his motorcycle.  A party of CNB officers tailed the rider and intercepted the motorcycle at the junction of Jalan Besar and Lavender Street.  Officers searched the rider, a 43-year-old male Malaysian, and recovered Erimin-5 tablets from him.  Cash of S$6,000 was also recovered from within a bag the man was carrying. 
Simultaneously, another party of CNB officers raided the unit along Hamilton Road.  Officers arrested the suspected drug syndicate leader, a 55-year-old male Singaporean, within the unit.  A search of the room recovered a total of more than 900g of heroin, about 400g of psychotropic drugs like ‘Ice’ and ketamine, more than 800 Erimin-5 tablets, about 90 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets and a small amount of cannabis and opium.  Three digital weighing scales and an improvised drug-smoking apparatus were also recovered.
Follow-up Arrests
Follow-up arrests were carried out in the same evening, when CNB officers arrested a 37-year-old male Singaporean, who is a suspected associate of the 55-year-old male, and another 55-year-old male Singaporean suspected drug abuser.
Investigations into the drug activities of the four suspects are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.  
Drugs inflict harm and suffering, not just on drug abusers, but also on their loved ones and on society at large.  The Central Narcotics Bureau takes a zero-tolerance stance on drugs and drug abuse, and will take strong action to ensure that drugs are kept off our streets.  CNB calls on the community to continue to support CNB and our zero-tolerance stance on drugs and drug abuse.  Together, we can keep Singapore safe from drugs and drug abuse.

Investigations into the drug activities of the four suspects are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.   Drugs inflict harm and suffering, not just on drug abusers, but also on their loved ones and on society at large.  The Central Narcotics Bureau takes a zero-tolerance stance on drugs and drug abuse, and will take strong action to ensure that drugs are kept off our streets.  CNB calls on the community to continue to support CNB and our zero-tolerance stance on drugs and drug abuse.  Together, we can keep Singapore safe from drugs and drug abuse.   CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

The competition was held from May to Sep 2015 and was opened to students and youths aged between 7 and 25.
The art competition was centred around an anti-drug theme, “Unity is Strength. Let Us Stand Against Drugs.”, where participants were required to depict how the community can work together as one against drugs through their artworks.
The judges are Mr Lawrence Koh Choon Teck and Miss Ivy Lam. Mr Lawrence Koh said “It was refreshing to see the works submitted by the youths. Some of them showed the depth of their thoughts about what they would like to convey in their pieces about the damage that drugs can bring. You get to see through their lenses and know how their perspective works. All these were done with minimal help and an intuitive feel of the theme given. Even the younger students between 7 to 12 grasped that adequately through their art pieces submitted. I believe that if they persevere with the 3 Ps - Passion in their art, determination to Practise and Patience for their hard work to bear fruits, we may see emerging young artists from amongst them.”

155,Preventive Drug Education toolkit for educators to protect our youths from drugs,2015-11-04,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/preventive-drug-education-toolkit-for-educators-to-protect-our-youths-from-drugs,"           Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Mr Desmond Lee, Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Mr Amrin Amin, Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Social and Family Development A/P Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Acting Director for the Central Narcotics Bureau Mr Winston Wong jointly launched a Preventive Drug Education (PDE) toolkit for educators today, at the ACT! Conference on At-Risk Youths. The toolkit was one of the recommendations1 announced by the Task Force on Youths and Drugs (TFYD) in June 2015.
 

          Developed by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), with inputs from the Ministry of Education (MOE), the toolkit aims to equip educators with knowledge on drug abuse, and enlist their help to support and keep youths away from drugs. Educators can refer to this toolkit when teaching their students about the harms of drug abuse. The toolkit comprises six sections:
     

Information on the commonly-abused drugs, the effects and dangers associated with abusing these drugs and inhalants, and the penalties for the possession, consumption or trafficking of these drugs in Singapore.
 
 Contacts and helplines which educators can refer to for additional assistance if they encounter a student with drug abuse problems, or if they require more information on drugs.
 
 Rehabilitation programmes available to youth drug abusers to help their rehabilitation from drug abuse.
 
Findings of a study on young abusers, commissioned by the TFYD and conducted by Home Team psychologists. It provides information on the profiles of youth abusers, their motivations, risk factors and views on drugs. It also lists the telltale signs of potential drug abuse among students, and ways that educators can help them say ‘no’ to drugs.
 
The laws protecting our youths from the drug threat and the penalties for committing drug or inhalant-related offences.
 
Suggested lesson plans that educators can use to conduct activities for their students, when teaching them about the harms of drug abuse.


 
         Speaking on the role of educators in the fight against drugs, Mr Amrin Amin said, “As educators and youth counsellors, you are our major touch-points with our youths and play a significant role in advancing our anti-drug cause. Your continued support has been and will continue to be crucial in our anti-drug efforts.”
 
          Mr Ganesh Kalyanam, Director of Student and Graduate Affairs at Republic Polytechnic and a member of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs Steering Committee, said, “Students nowadays are exposed to mass media and social media influences which glamorise the use of drugs such as cannabis. The toolkit is useful as it equips us with information and creative ideas on how to better engage our students on the dangers of drugs.”
 
          The soft copy of the toolkit can be downloaded on the CNB website2. Copies of the toolkits will be distributed to schools in January 2016. A toolkit for parents will be launched next year.

SPEECH BY PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR HOME AFFAIRS MR AMRIN AMIN:
LAUNCH OF PREVENTIVE DRUG EDUCATION TOOLKIT ON 4 NOV 2015 
AT THE ACT! CONFERENCE ON AT-RISK YOUTHS 
 
Mr Desmond Lee, Chairman of the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabiliation, and Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs,
A/P Faishal, Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
 
        Thank you for joining me this morning as we launch the Preventive Drug Education toolkit for educators and counsellors.
 
Drug Situation Among Youths
 

      This toolkit was one of the key recommendations of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs, which completed its report a few months ago.
 
      The Taskforce was convened because there were some worrying drug trends among youths. First, there are more young drug abusers aged below 30 who have been arrested in recent years. In 2014, 1,110 young abusers were arrested, compared to 826 in 2010. This is a 34% increase. Second, new drug abusers arrested are generally younger. The proportion of new abusers arrested who are aged below 30 has risen from about half in 2010 to two-thirds in 2014. Third, the profile of young abusers has changed. We are beginning to arrest young drug abusers who are doing well in their studies and who come from middle-class families. This is not a segment of the youth population that typically consumes drugs. Many youths of this profile are cannabis abusers. They abuse cannabis because of the misperception that it is not addictive or harmful. Fourth, clusters of young cannabis abusers are emerging. A cluster develops when one young person takes cannabis.  He then introduces it to his friends, who in turn introduce it to their friends. This creates a multiplier effect. 
 
      These trends remind us that we must continue with our efforts to tackle the drug scourge decisively. We must focus on upstream preventive drug education efforts and educate our young that drugs cause harm. There is no such thing as a “soft” drug. Our young people should stay clear of drugs. This is our first and most important line of defence against drugs.
 
A Toolkit for Educators and Counsellors
 
      To do this, we need to reach out not only to our youths, but also to those who are critical in shaping their lives and their values. This is why the Central Narcotics Bureau or CNB has, with the help of MOE, developed a preventive drug education toolkit for educators and counsellors.
 
      The toolkit will help in two ways. First, it contains useful information about the drug situation in Singapore – what the common illicit drugs are, what our laws state about drug abuse, and what rehabilitation programmes are available for young drug abusers. 
 
      Second, the toolkit provides tips to recognise warning signs of a potential drug problem, and who educators and counsellors should call to seek help from. There are also suggested lesson plans and activities to help youths understand why drugs are harmful and how they can stay away from drugs. 
 
      CNB will be distributing this toolkit to schools and tertiary institutions by Jan 2016. I hope that you will find this toolkit useful in your interactions with your students. We are also developing a similar toolkit for parents, which will be launched by the middle of next year. 
 
Everyone has a part to play

      Ladies and Gentlemen, our fight against drugs requires a whole-of-society effort. Everyone has a part to play. As educators and youth counsellors, you are our major touch-points with our youths and play a significant role in advancing our anti-drug cause.
 
  Your continued support has been and will continue to be crucial in our anti-drug efforts. I hope that you will continue to work closely with us to protect our youths from drugs. Together, we can keep Singapore drug-free.
 
  Thank you.

156,1.2kg heroin and other drugs seized in two CNB operations on 29 October 2015 four arrested,2015-10-30,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/1.2kg-heroin-and-other-drugs-seized-in-two-cnb-operations-on-29-october-2015-four-arrested," On 29 October 2015, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) carried out two separate operations which netted a total of about 1.2kg of heroin, 445g of cannabis, 69g of ‘Ice’ and 183 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets.  The haul of drugs is estimated to be worth more than S$118,000.  A total of 4 suspected drug offenders, all Singaporeans, were arrested.
‘Orange Grove’ Drug Store
In the late-morning of 29 October 2015, CNB officers raided a suspected drug store in a private apartment at Orange Grove Road.  The suspected drug trafficker had just replenished his stock of drugs.  
After CNB officers entered the suspected drug store, a second-floor unit, officers noticed that the master bedroom window of the unit was broken.  Officers noticed two male suspects at the ground floor and they subsequently entered a vacant unit on the ground floor.  Both male suspects, aged 30 and 32, were arrested within the vacant unit. They were then brought to their rented cars.  A search of both rented cars was conducted and about 12g of heroin and 9g of ‘Ice’ were recovered from the car rented by the 30-year-old male.  
A search of the second floor unit was done and drugs were recovered from the master bedroom.  Officers also recovered drugs contained within a pouch found on the ledge outside the unit.  About 704g of heroin, 445g of cannabis, 59g of ‘Ice’ and 183 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets were recovered.  Knives, parangs and a replica gun were recovered from within the unit.  Cash of S$6,024 was also recovered [see photos below].

Drug Supplier & Trafficker Client Arrested
In a separate operation in the late-afternoon of the same day, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Boon Lay Drive to apprehend a suspected drug supplier who was delivering a consignment of drugs to his client.  Officers spotted the suspected supplier, a 38-year-old male, entering a carpark in a blue-coloured car.  He then met up with the suspected trafficker, a 41-year-old female, at the second floor of the block and both parted ways shortly after.
CNB officers arrested the suspected supplier before he got back into his car.  A search of the car was conducted and officers found about 228g of heroin contained in a bag at the front passenger seat.  Another 40g of heroin was found concealed in a compartment behind the rear seat [see photo below].

Simultaneously, another party of CNB officers raided the unit of the 41-year-old female suspected trafficker.  About 91g of heroin, a small amount of ‘Ice’ and a digital weighing scale were recovered from within the unit.  
The 38-year-old suspected drug supplier was brought back to his hideout in Jalan Bukit Merah and a search of the hideout recovered about 157g of heroin that was wrapped in newspaper and hidden inside a soft toy.  
Investigations into the drug activities of the four suspects are ongoing.  If convicted, the four may face the death penalty.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.

[1] Lysergide (LSD) is a hallucinogen. It is often sold on blotting paper, which is usually imprinted with a colourful cartoon or design. Although abusers generally take it orally, the tabs of blotting paper are also placed on skin areas that readily absort the drug into the bloodstream, for example, under the eyelid. When ingested, LSD takes effect within 30 minutes. Its effects are strongest after 3 to 5 hours and can last up to 12 hours. Bad ‘trips’ can trigger sever panic, paranoia and confusion. The abuser may also feel depressed after using LSD.

Officers were deployed in the afternoon of 22 October 2015 to conduct observation on a suspected local drug syndicate in the Clementi area. The syndicate was believed to have received a fresh consignment of drugs.            
At about 4pm, a 44-year-old man was seen meeting up with another 41-year-old man, both Singaporeans, outside his unit in Clementi. Both parted ways shortly, and the 41-year-old male suspect was swiftly arrested. Officers escorted him to his unit in the vicinity of Clementi Ave 1. A search recovered a total of about 2.2kg of cannabis and some drug paraphernalia, including a digital weighing scale. 
Meanwhile, officers continued to monitor the other suspect, and officers later spotted him with another suspect, a 29-year-old Singaporean male and a 33-year-old female suspected drug abuser, outside a parked white car in a multi-storey carpark. All three were arrested. 
A separate search of the 44-year-old suspect’s house in Clementi Road led to the seizure of about 1kg of cannabis. A subsequent search of the 29-year-old suspect’s hideout in River Valley Road recovered a small amount of cannabis, ‘Ice’, Erimin-5 tablets and drug paraphernalia. A small amount of Erimin-5 tablets were also found on the 33-year-old female suspected drug abuser. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing.  Those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis may face the death penalty. In its review of Singapore’s drug situation in June 2015, the Task Force on Youths and Drugs said that cannabis is addictive and harmful. Its use could also lead to the abuse of other drugs such as heroin and methamphetamine. CNB will continue to continue to stay vigilant against the harm of cannabis and other drugs and prevent the flow of drugs to the ground.

Introduction
 

           The Home Team celebrates 50 years of nation building with a series of SG50 events to honour our Home Team Pioneers. 
 
           Today, I am delighted to join you at this Appreciation Dinner, to thank past and serving CNB officers who have contributed to Singapore’s fight against the drugs scourge over the past 44 years. 
 
           We gather here today to recognise and honour our Pioneer Officers who have built a strong foundation for the CNB, which has grown from strength to strength, to become a well-respected drug enforcement agency. 
 
           The theme for today’s event - ‘‘Our Home, Our Memories” - is apt to recognise the contributions of  CNB Pioneer Officers in ensuring a safe and secure home, where fond shared memories are made. We can live, work and play safely because you have done your duty for the country. I am sure the CNB Pioneer Officers would also recall the shared memories of the CNB, which many of you have regarded as your “Second Home”.
 
 
Being proud of our past
 
           Drugs destroy lives and families. The opium problem dogged Singapore for more than a century since the 1900s. While the use of opium slowly declined after opium smoking was made illegal in 1946, new drug threats, such as heroin, MX pills and cannabis, emerged in the late 1960s. 
 
           Drug activities continued to be widespread into the 1970s, leading to downstream social problems. CNB Pioneer Officers recognised the ill-effects of drugs not only on the addicts, but also their families and the society. Many have witnessed first-hand, how families were torn apart when a member became involved in drugs.
 
           CNB was formed in 1971 to tackle the worsening drug situation. CNB had a humble beginning in the early days as a small force with less than 20 officers seconded from the Police and Customs. 
 
           You did not have an enviable job then. There was rampant social unrest, drug and crime rates were high, and work conditions were tough. CNB Pioneer Officers would remember the early days when high-speed car chases in rural areas like Lim Chu Kang and shophouse rooftop chases were common occurrences in a day’s work. Even when they were off-duty, the Pioneer Officers would need to go to a public telephone to call the hotline every hour to check if there was any recall, as many homes did not have telephones then, let alone handphones. In spite of all these challenges, you were fearless and united in a common purpose to keep our streets free of drugs. 
 
           CNB’s work did not stop with the arrests drug offenders. The Pioneer Officers also made sure abusers stay clear of drugs after their release from the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC). Work was from dusk till dawn for many officers in the Supervision Division in the 1970s. Mornings were spent at the Supervision Division in the former Rumah Miskin Police Station, where officers would talk to supervisees about their problems. In the evenings, officers would travel to the Police Division on bicycles to supervise addicts reporting for urine tests. 
 
         Take Mr Kandasamy Renganathan, a veteran CNB officer with more than 40 years of service, for example. His greatest satisfaction was seeing former supervisees wean off drugs, and reunited with their families. I am sure many of our CNB Pioneer Officers seated here tonight share his sentiment. Work might be arduous, but it was rewarding, especially when you played a key role in turning around the lives of abusers and their families.
 
Contributing to our present 
 
 
         In May this year, CNB unveiled its new vision and mission statements which underscore every CNB officer’s commitment to build a drug-free Singapore. CNB’s work is indeed a calling that officers past and present have answered with a lifelong commitment. 
 
         I am delighted to hear that many of our Home Team Pioneers have gone beyond their call of duty to continue to contribute to the Home Team and Singapore after their retirement, in different roles and capacities. 
 
         Mr Poh Geok Ek, who served as Director/CNB and Director/Prisons during his service with the Home Team, continues to serve as President of the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) after his retirement in 1998*. He also continues to be an active member of the anti-drug community, working alongside CNB.  
 
         We can have no better anti-drug advocates than you, our Home Team Pioneers. All of you here are well-placed and well-equipped to champion our anti-drug cause within your respective communities with your vast experience and knowledge. 
 
 
         You have played a key role in building up the CNB that we are proud of today. Through the years, you have built capabilities and transformed the CNB.  Notably, the success of Operation Ferret provided the strong foundation for our rigorous and tough enforcement against drug abuse.
 
 
Securing our Future
 
 
         But it is not sufficient to rest on the laurels of our past successes. With the passage of time, the modus operandi and profiles of drug offenders have evolved.  We now have drug syndicates who exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity of the Internet to commit drug activities that know no physical borders. We are now seeing new psychoactive substances entering the market, and a worrying trend of youth abusers. 
 
         To deal with this myriad of challenges, the current generation of CNB officers will need to constantly review your operating paradigm, to create new approaches and solutions to tackle new emerging threats and maintain public confidence in your work to keep Singapore drug-free.  
 
         To serving officers, build on the foundation set by the Pioneer Officers to create a safe and secure Singapore. We must press on to plan and build up our capability to “future-proof” the CNB, to ensure that it  continues to be successful in its mission to “Enforce, Educate and Engage” for a drug-free Singapore.  
 
Conclusion
 
         I am glad to see many of our CNB Pioneer Officers here this evening. We could not have kept the drug situation under control, without your pioneering spirit of courage and dedication. With the solid foundations that you have laid, our job has become much easier. 
 
         To show our appreciation, we have specially commissioned a Home Team SG50 medallion. This is a small token of the Home Team’s appreciation for your years of loyal service and dedication. We salute you for all that you have done for the nation. 
 
         To the family members of our CNB Pioneer Officers, let me extend my heartfelt appreciation to each and every one of you for your strong support and understanding throughout the Pioneer Officers’ years of service in CNB. Many of them worked long hours, sometimes in dangerous and difficult situations, often called away for duties during festive periods, public holidays and even milestone family events. It was only with your support, encouragement and understanding that they were able to dedicate themselves fully to the important work of keeping Singapore drug-free. 
 
         Let us dedicate ourselves to building a safe and secure home, so that we can achieve together another 50 years of peace and prosperity and celebrate our 100th birthday with pride.

162,"26 traffickers and 55 abusers arrested, S$314,000 worth of drugs seized in three-day CNB operation.",2015-10-08,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/26-traffickers-and-55-abusers-arrested-s314-000-worth-of-drugs-seized-in-three-day-cnb-operation," 26 suspected drug traffickers and 55 suspected drug abusers were arrested during an intensive three-day island-wide operation mounted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) to target syndicated drug trafficking activities.
In the operation between 5 to 8 October 2015, CNB seized about 3kg of heroin, 495g of ‘Ice’, 326 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 64 Erimin-5 tablets, 42g of cannabis and a small amount of new psychoactive substances (NPS).  The entire haul of drugs is estimated to be worth more than S$314,000.  
Heroin haul at Woodlands
In one of the cases in the three-day operation, CNB officers seized a total of about 1,571g of heroin and 38g of ‘Ice’, estimated to be worth about S$116,000.  On the night of 5 October 2015, CNB officers deployed in the vicinity of Woodlands Crescent arrested a suspected drug trafficker and a suspected drug courier.  From the suspected drug trafficker, a 42-year-old female Singaporean, officers recovered about 1,567g of heroin and 27g of ‘Ice’.  Cash of S$9,120 was recovered from the suspected drug courier, a 36-year-old male Malaysian.  
In the follow-up raid on the hideout of the suspected trafficker, officers arrested a 64-year-old male Singaporean associate of the suspected trafficker and a 47-year-old female Singaporean suspected abuser.  From within the unit, officers recovered a total of about 11g of ‘Ice’, 30 Erimin-5 tablets, a small amount of heroin and various drug paraphernalia such as a digital weighing scale and numerous empty plastic sachets.

Jurong West drug ring busted


In another case in the three-day operation, CNB officers seized a total of about 926g of heroin and 438g of ‘Ice’, estimated to be worth about S$143,000.  On the night of 6 October 2015, CNB officers deployed in Jurong West had observed a Singapore-registered black car meeting up with a Malaysia-registered lorry.  Of the three males in the car, one male left the car to approach the lorry, and both vehicles parted ways after the male went back to the car.
The Singapore-registered car was tailed to a mall in Jurong, where one male passenger alighted and the car went off.  CNB officers arrested the man, a 34-year-old Singaporean, a short while later and recovered a total of about 51g of ‘Ice’ from him.  
The black car was tailed to the vicinity of Jurong West Street 92, where officers observed a female approach the car and then left.  The female suspected trafficker, a 28-year-old Singaporean, was placed under arrest.  A total of about 926g of heroin and 256g of ‘Ice’ were recovered from within a plastic bag in her possession.  
Meanwhile, the black car had proceeded to nearby Jurong West Street 91, where the remaining male passenger alighted.  Shortly thereafter, CNB officers moved in to arrest the 43-year-old Singaporean suspected trafficker.  A small amount of heroin and cash of S$4,600 was recovered from him.
The driver of the black car, a suspected trafficker, was subsequently arrested along Jurong West Street 93.  A search of the car recovered a total of about 131g of ‘Ice’.  
Another party of officers tailing the Malaysia-registered lorry saw it come to a stop along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, near Tuas Checkpoint.  Sensing an opportune moment when the lorry driver had alighted, officers moved in to place both driver and passenger under arrest.  Both suspected drug couriers are 30-year-old male Malaysians.

Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested persons are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g, and if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week, while 250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week[2].

Large cannabis seizure 
On the afternoon of 21 September 2015, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Havelock Road and at Senoko, to conduct observation on a suspected local drug trafficker [male, 34] and his local accomplice [male, 29].  The duo was believed to be expecting a fresh consignment of drugs.  The suspected drug trafficker was using a car as a “mobile drug store”.  
At about 1.45pm, officers deployed at Senoko spotted the suspected drug trafficker and his associate in the vicinity of Senoko Drive in another car.  Officers also spotted a Malaysia-registered lorry in the vicinity. The driver of the lorry, a 34-year-old male Malaysian, was observed to have left the lorry carrying a red-colour plastic bag. He approached the car and was observed to place the plastic bag onto the rear seat of the car. The driver of the lorry then returned to the lorry.  Both vehicles then parted, with each vehicle driving off in different directions.
At about 2.20pm, the lorry was stopped at the Woodlands Checkpoint with the assistance of the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the driver placed under arrest. 
At about 2.30pm, the suspected local drug trafficker and his accomplice were arrested along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1.  A red-colour plastic bag was found within the car and about 5kg of cannabis recovered from within the plastic bag.  From the center console of the car, officers recovered three tobacco packets containing about 60g of cannabis.  A search of the 29-year-old male Singaporean recovered three packets of ‘Ice’ and cash amounting to S$11,300.  A car key was also found on the front passenger seat.
Both men were subsequently escorted to the “mobile drug store” parked in a multi-storey carpark in Havelock.  Using the car key recovered earlier, officers gained access to the “mobile drug store” and recovered a total of about 750g of cannabis, 350g of ‘Ice’, a weighing scale and some drug paraphernalia.  A chopper was also found.  
Cocktail of drugs seized at Balestier
In a separate operation conducted on the same afternoon, CNB officers arrested a suspected drug abuser along Balestier Road.  A search of the 39-year-old male Singaporean found a small amount of ‘Ice’, ketamine and Erimin-5 tablets.  The male suspect was then led to a hotel room in the area, believed to be used as a drug store.  Officers found various types of drugs, including heroin and tablets of various colours from within the room. The drugs, as well as a digital weighing scale and two improvised drug-smoking apparatus, were seized.  
At about 6.05pm, a party of CNB officers conducting observation at another part of the hotel arrested a 43-year-old male Singaporean suspected drug abuser shortly after he had left his room.  A search of the room found various drugs including heroin, ‘Ice’ and ketamine.  A digital weighing scale and numerous empty plastic packets were also found.  
Later that same evening, CNB officers arrested a 40-year-old male suspected drug trafficker along Balestier Road, believed to be the accomplice of the two males arrested earlier the same day.  A search of the 40-year-old male Singaporean recovered a total of about 300g of ‘Ice’, 240g of ketamine and 3,602 Erimin-5 tablets.  Cash amounting to S$13,381 was also recovered from him.  The 40-year-old male is wanted in connection to an earlier case where about 1kg of cannabis and 167g of ‘Ice’ were seized on 15 September 2015.
Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested persons are ongoing.  Those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis or trafficking in more than 250g of methamphetamine may face the death penalty.

ASIA-PACIFIC FORUM AGAINST DRUGS
Working towards a “Drug Free Society for Our Children”
 
The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) of Singapore organised the Asia-Pacific Forum Against Drugs (APFAD) on 27 August 2015. The Forum brought together local and foreign participants from government agencies, non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society groups, all with a common purpose of discussing how best to address the worrying global trend of drug liberalisation and the relentless lobbying of the pro-drug groups. 
The upcoming United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS-WDP) in April 2016 will discuss the future of the global drug regime. NCADA is concerned with the weakening of global attitudes against drugs and the push for more liberal drug policies. To protect our children’s future, there is a need to strengthen the resilience of our society and youths against illicit drugs, and unite anti-drug advocates in the Asia-Pacific region to stand together to emphasise the relevance and importance of a drug-free society.
APFAD aims to rally people across the Asia-Pacific region against drugs and raise awareness of the lobbying efforts by pro-drug groups. Close to 200 participants from 18 countries mainly from the Asia Pacific region, attended the forum.  Foreign and local speakers addressed various aspects of the drug abuse situation. Among them was Secretary General for the European Cities Against Drugs, Mr Erik Leijonmarck, who spoke about how anti-drug advocates could constructively engage in the global drug policy debate at UNGASS-WDP 2016. Dr Kevin Sabet, the Director of the Drug Policy Institute in Florida, elaborated on the challenges posed by efforts to regulate the use and production of cannabis. 
Mr Victor Lye, Chairman of NCADA, rallied the APFAD participants to adopt an APFAD Declaration as a statement of common purpose. He said: “All of us have a stake in building a drug-free society for our children. We are very encouraged by the support of participants at the Forum today. In every ground-up initiative, we all know that the beginning is the hardest. However, given the importance of our cause, we shall persist in our efforts. I hope APFAD participants will uphold the APFAD Declaration in their home countries and promote the green and white anti-drug ribbon as our collective symbol for the anti-drug cause through social media and other channels. We need to secure strong support from our people to build a drug-free society for our children. We need to stand together to oppose the legalisation of drugs and speak up for our children at the UNGASS-WDP in April 2016.”   
NCADA will make the APFAD Declaration available on its website by September so that like-minded individuals and the community can also speak up and make a similar stand against drugs. A copy of the APFAD Declaration is provided at Annex for reference.

Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Welcome to the Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs!
 
About NCADA
 

        The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) is the voice of Singapore’s anti-drug movement. Bringing together members of Singapore’s anti-drug ecosystem across both the private and public sectors, NCADA rallies community support for Singapore’s zero tolerance stance against drug abuse. 
 
        Zero-tolerance means:
     

       We reject the scourge of drug abuse;
 
       We do not want harmful drugs in our society;
 
       We tackle both supply and demand aspects of drug abuse;
 
       We are tough against those who profit off drug abusers; and
 
       We rehabilitate drug abusers, while deterring repeat abusers.


 
Resisting the Pro-Drug Lobby
 
        Like other anti-drug advocates and community leaders across the globe, I am alarmed by the progress of the pro-drug lobby. Driven by greed and profit, the pro-drug lobby aims to remove the prohibitive provisions of the UN drug conventions, and pave the way for eventual legalization of drugs. 
 
        It may surprise you that drugs were once legal in Singapore. When Singapore was a British Colony, the Customs Department in 1910 collected levies from the legal sale of opium. By 1932, the revenue collected from opium reached S$5.9 million, an enormous sum in those days. However, the social cost of legalised opium proved too high. Opium consumption was linked to crime, violence and the breakdown of the family unit. In 1946, opium was banned. We are better off after the ban, but the harm done to opium addicts and their families was to persist well into the 1970s. It would be a tragedy if history were to be repeated and drugs made legal again.
 
        Drug legalisation will not solve the drug abuse problem. On the contrary, legalisation sends the wrong signal about the harm caused by drugs. In fact, it may lead to more addiction, as well as other health and social problems. 
 
        Arguments to legalize the drug trade are cunningly couched in eloquent socio-economic and health related cost-benefit arguments. One major motive is profit. This is clearly seen in the excited Wall Street talk about the “Cannabis Dividend” by financial and business interests. The profits will be squeezed out from the millions more drug abusers that the pro-drug lobby is seeking to ensnare. These future drug abusers being sought by the pro-drug lobby are our children! 
 
APFAD
 
        As anti-drug advocates, we must unite and take a stand for the sake of our children. NCADA hopes to rally like-minded anti-drug advocates to resist the relentless money-driven march of the pro-drug lobby, starting first in Asia, before linking up with anti-drug advocates across the globe. 
 
        To this end, I championed the idea for APFAD after attending the 2014 World Forum Against Drugs (WFAD) in Stockholm. At the WFAD, I met many like-minded anti-drugs NGOs and civil society groups. I was impressed by their resolve to resist the drug scourge as they shared best practices and presented scientific evidence to debunk the pro-drug lobby. However, Asia Pacific anti-drug advocates were noticeably absent. 
 
        I am therefore heartened to see almost 200 like-minded anti-drug advocates across 18 countries gathered here today at the first APFAD.  I warmly welcome each one of you as well as ASEAN Senior Officials, fresh from your 36th ASEAN Senior Officials’ Meeting on Drugs. I wish to thank the NCADA Secretariat, the Central Narcotics Bureau and the Ministry of Home Affairs for making this historic and important event possible. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the encouragement and support of Minister Masagos in this challenging but satisfying anti-drug cause. 
 
    This APFAD is a timely networking and resource sharing platform for us like-minded anti-drug advocates. We will learn much from the presentations about youth drug abusers by Ms Vasuki Utravathy, Singapore Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Dr Jasmin Kaur of the Singapore Prison Service (SPS). 
 
    Mr Pubudu Sumanasekara, from the IOGT Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC), Mr Tay Bian How of the Colombo Plan Secretariat and Mr Abdul Karim from the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) will share their respective organisations’ experiences on preventive education, treatment, rehabilitation and the reintegration of drug abusers into society. 
 
Preparing for UNGASS 2016
 
    The UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) will be held in April 2016 in New York. UNGASS in 1998 espoused the aim of a “Drug Free World” and the total eradication of drug supply and abuse. However, today, many countries are considering decriminalising drug use – and for some, legalisation – as well as taking a public health approach to tackling drug abuse.
 
    ASEAN is the only regional bloc that has maintained a consistent drug-free stance in drug control policies. I trust that the 36th Meeting of ASEAN Senior Officials on Drug Matters (ASOD) hosted by Singapore in the last few days will strengthen the resolve to coordinate our respective government’s positions ahead of UNGASS 2016.
 
    UNGASS 2016 is an inclusive process. Member states are encouraged to engage civil society organisations and NGOs on the world drug problem. Therefore, I urge all of you to work closely with your respective governments to have your voices heard and resist the pro-drug lobby. We must not allow the pro-drug lobby dismantle or weaken the UN’s anti-drug stance as a first step to hooking our children into consuming drugs. Ultimately, we are fighting for the rights of our children to grow up in a drug-free society. 
 
    I am glad that Mr Erik Leijonmarck, Secretary General, European Cities Against Drugs (ECAD) – is here with us at APFAD. He will share insights on the “Road to UNGASS 2016”. Please tap into Eric’s wealth of knowledge in this subject – and build up our case to resist the pro-drug lobby.
 
The Cannabis Trojan Horse
 
    The pro-drug lobby has a Trojan Horse in its spearhead cannabis legalization agenda. We must prevent it from reaching our shores. In May 2014, Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalize the production, sale and consumption of cannabis. In the USA, 23 states have moved to legalise medicinal cannabis while four of those have done the same for recreational use. This violates US Federal Laws and the UN drug conventions.  But the US Constitution limits the powers of the Federal Government to enforce its laws on the states. This US incapacity to enforce federal drug laws has dire global consequences.
 
    The USA has been the leading light for other countries to adhere to the UN drug conventions. However, the pro-drug lobby’s progress in undermining domestic USA drug policy will embellish weak countries to backpedal on their anti-drug efforts, with consequential escalation in organized crime and money laundering. 
 
    This is the global drug policy conundrum as the USA, the leading international enforcer of drugs prohibition is being undermined at home by the pro-drug lobby’s “medical cannabis” Trojan Horse. Moreover, the soft power of the USA is being exploited by the pro-drug lobby to change societal attitudes towards drugs. US pop culture, celebrity endorsements and misguided campaigners are promoting the false notion that cannabis is harmless – all to build a new multi-billion dollar drug market targeting our children. 
 
    The scientific evidence is damning. Cannabis use affects brain development and lowers the IQ of adolescent users, leading to cognitive problems in everyday life[1].  Other research shows that cannabis addiction is several times higher if the abuser is a teenager. Cannabis is a gateway drug, with cannabis abusers highly likely to abuse other drugs.[2]  Yet, the cannabis legalization movement ignores such scientific evidence - only to wax lyrical about medical use to push its agenda. This is nothing more than an evil guise for ruthless profiteers. 
 
 
Adopt Green & White Ribbon as our Anti-drug Symbol
 
    Minister Masagos has shared with you the significance of the Green & White Anti-Drug Symbol - ‘Health’, ‘Vitality’ and ‘Strength’. In Singapore, we encourage our students to put on this Green & White Ribbon on World Drug Day (June 26) each year as a sign of their solidarity with our anti-drug cause. 
 
    I am happy to learn that the ASEAN Senior Officials’ Meeting on Drug Matters which concluded yesterday – has proposed to adopt the Green & White Ribbon as the anti-drug symbol for ASEAN. But this symbol belongs to the children of this world, whose future drug-free society we are fighting for.
 
    I urge you as APFAD participants to recognise and adopt this Green & White Ribbon as our common anti-drug symbol. Upon return to your home countries, raise awareness of our collective anti-drug cause by promoting this symbol through social media initiatives and your anti-drug campaigns. NCADA will be happy to work with you wherever possible in this outcome.
 
APFAD Declaration
 
    As anti-drug advocates, our voices must be heard collectively, loudly and clearly. To this end, it is important for every APFAD participant to endorse the APFAD Declaration which espouses the vision of a drug-free society for our children. Please read it and let it resonate within your hearts as fathers and mothers, as brothers and sisters – as members of humanity – for the sake of our children. Sign it and help us speak with one voice for our children at this APFAD.
 
    NCADA will make the Declaration available online and propagate it via social media so that like-minded individuals and the community can also speak up and make a similar stand against drugs. I implore you to do the same for your respective countries upon your return.
 
Conclusion
 
    Our children’s future is at stake. Our strong anti-drug stance is about our values and the kind of society we want our children to grow up in. Unlike the pro-drug lobby, there is no profit to fund anti-drug advocacy. Instead, we are driven by our fundamental duty to protect our children’s future. We need to stand together and oppose the legalisation of drugs. We must speak up for our children at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) in April 2016.
 
    As pointed out by Minister Masagos, the support of the community is vital for our vision of a drug free society for our children. APFAD participants must take this lead to rally our respective peoples. As we return to our home countries, I call on each of you to discuss with your respective anti-drug organisations to join hands with NCADA to achieve the following outcomes:
     

    Endorse, uphold and promote the APFAD Declaration in your home countries.
 
    Adopt and promote the Green & White Ribbon as our common anti-drug symbol to your respective communities.
 
    Work with NCADA to build an online APFAD advocacy network 
 
    Link up with WFAD and other like-minded anti-drug advocates internationally to speak up for our children at UNGASS 2016 


 
 Let us unite in our common vision to build a drug free society for our children. The time to act is now.

 
Thank you.

Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, Central Narcotics Bureau,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
Good morning.
I am very happy to welcome you to the first-ever Asia-Pacific Forum against Drugs (APFAD) today. I want to thank the National Council Against Drug Abuse, or NCADA, for creating this platform, that gathers like-minded individuals from government and non-government organisations (NGOs) across the region to exchange knowledge and experience in our work to build a drug-free society. 
 
A Drug-Free Asia-Pacific for our Children
 

          The theme for this forum is “A Drug-Free Asia-Pacific for our Children”. We are here today because we all share a common vision – to build a drug-free society for our children. In Singapore, we adopt a firm zero-tolerance stance against drugs. Singaporeans appreciate and enjoy the safe drug-free environment for our children and families, made possible by our comprehensive anti-drug policies. However, we cannot be complacent in this ongoing fight against drugs as the global drug situation remains challenging.
 
          In recent years, we have seen growing calls from pro-drug lobbyists to decriminalise drug use and even legalise certain drugs. Many pro-drug activists have framed the fight against drugs as a “failed war” and are moving away from drug controls, and supporting approaches such as decriminalisation and legalisation. Some countries in Europe and South America, as well as some states in the USA, have adopted such policies and are also encouraging others to do the same. They have chosen this approach because they could not keep drug abuse low. Therefore, they focus instead on increasing their tax revenues or alleviating prison overcrowding through decriminalisation and legalisation. Hence, the next global debate on drug policies at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) in 2016 will mark an important crossroads in our fight against drugs.
 
          The misconceptions being propagated on cannabis are another worrying development. Pro-drug lobbyists claim that cannabis is neither harmful nor addictive. However, there are compelling studies which show the permanent deterioration in brain functions of youths who use cannabis. There are also claims made about the efficacy of cannabis as a medicine. In fact, the medical benefits of cannabis are not conclusive at this point. Much more medical research and tests are still needed. Furthermore, even if it is proven that cannabis has medicinal value, the answer is still not de-criminalisation or legalisation. Cannabis must still be controlled and administered in the same professional manner as other drugs, such as the use of morphine for pain management. 
 
          We are worried that these global trends are influencing our young people to take a liberal view on drug use. This is where we, as a community, will need to stand firm, and stand together, to proactively dispel these myths. In order to safeguard our children’s future, we must stay committed to building a drug-free community for all.  
 
Community Togetherness
 
          In recent years, Singapore has seen an increasing trend of drug use by young persons below the age of 30. I am sure this development is not unique to us and is a problem shared by our fellow participants. In a 2013 youth perception survey, we found that Singaporean youths, particularly those aged 16 to 21, tend to have more liberal attitudes towards drugs. They perceive drugs such as cannabis to be less harmful and addictive than “hard” drugs such as heroin and are hence more willing to experiment with these “soft” drugs. The misperception is perpetuated by information that is easily found on the internet, which is not necessarily accurate and may be half-truths, misinformation, and lies. 
 
          To tackle these trends, in November 2014, we convened a Task Force on Youths and Drugs, which I co-chaired with Minister of State Sim Ann. The Task Force involved representatives from government agencies, as well as non-government organisations and community partners. The organiser for the APFAD, NCADA, was one of the community organisations on the Task Force. The Task Force has since completed its review and one of its key recommendations was to enhance preventive drug education outreach to older youths aged above 16. We believe that effective preventive drug education is our first line of defence against drugs. 
 
          The Taskforce also recommended building a community of advocates against drugs. Singapore’s experience with this Task Force, and indeed, in our ongoing fight to combat drugs, has been that it is crucial to partner and harness the support of different community stakeholders in order for our efforts to be effective. “Community Togetherness” allows us to better tackle the complex issue of drugs more effectively and holistically.
 
One Asia-Pacific Against Drugs
 
          This is why I am very glad that NCADA has taken the initiative and the bold step of organising this first-ever Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs, or APFAD in short. APFAD is a good platform for learning and networking. NCADA has put together a comprehensive programme and has invited speakers like Mr Erik Leijonmarck and Mr Kevin Sabet, who will share their experiences and research findings with you later today on UNGASS 2016 and on cannabis respectively. NCADA has also invited Mr Tay Bian How from the Colombo Plan, Mr Pubudu Sumanasekara from IOGT International, and other practitioners from Singapore, to share more about preventive drug education, treatment and rehabilitation.
 
      I am also very encouraged to see so many familiar faces from within Singapore’s anti-drug ecosystem, and also new friends, from the Asia-Pacific region and even beyond. Let us take this opportunity to not only learn from the speakers, but also from each other, and to build up and strengthen our networks and partnerships with each other. 
 
      Ladies and Gentlemen, please also take a look in the APFAD conference kit which was specially prepared for you. In there, you will find a green and white anti-drug collar pin that is attached to a card holder. The green and white colours of the anti-drug ribbon signify ‘Health’, ‘Vitality’ and ‘Strength’. Do wear this anti-drug ribbon during the forum as a symbol of our united stand against drugs.   
 
      Last but not least, I understand that NCADA, as the organiser of the forum, plans to put together an “APFAD Declaration”. I encourage all participants to give their endorsement to make our stand against drugs clear to the rest of the world. 
The Declaration comprises key points of consensus centred on APFAD’s vision of a drug-free society for our children. Drug abuse destroys lives and families. The addict causes harm not just to himself and his family, but also to his community and his society.
    
 
      Apart from endorsing the Declaration, I also urge all of you to work with your respective governments to put across a clear and unequivocal position at UNGASS 2016 that there are still countries and organisations that have not given up the fight against drugs, and are working hard to achieve a society free from drug abuse, for the sake of our children. 
 
Conclusion
 
      Ladies and Gentlemen, our fight against drugs can only be effective if our communities continue to support the fight against the scourge of drugs. This cannot just be a whole-of-Government effort. It needs to be a whole-of-Society effort. We need all citizens to participate in every way they can – for example, by educating our children about drugs, or by helping addicts reintegrate into society. Lastly, as one united anti-drug community, we need to send a strong signal opposing drug abuse taking root in society.
 
      With the joint efforts of non-government organisations, governments around the world, and the United Nations, I believe that it is possible to realise our vision of a drug-free world. I wish you a fruitful discussion ahead. Thank you.

Executive Summary
 
The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested 1,717 drug abusers[1] in the first half of 2015. This is an increase of 10% from the 1,560 drug abusers arrested in the first half of 2014. About 37% (629) of all drug abusers arrested were new abusers. Among the new abusers, 71% (446) were below 30 years old. This is a slight increase from the corresponding period a year ago, when new abusers below 30 years of age made up 69% (338) of new abusers arrested.  
Methamphetamine and heroin continued to be the two most commonly abused drugs, with such abusers making up over 93% (1,595) of all drug abusers arrested. Methamphetamine abusers made up slightly more than half (53% or 915) of all abusers arrested, followed by heroin (40% or 680). The number of cannabis abusers grew by 20% from the first half of 2014 (from 83 to 100).  Among the new abusers, methamphetamine abusers made up the largest group at 76% (475), followed by cannabis (13% or 81) and heroin (9% or 59) abusers.
Seizures of cannabis, ‘Ecstasy’, ketamine and nimetazepam increased, while seizures of heroin and ‘Ice’ (crystalline methamphetamine) decreased in the first half of 2015, compared to the same period last year.  Notably, cannabis seizures increased by 174%, from 8.81kg to 24.12kg.
CNB will remain vigilant and monitor the drug situation closely.  We will continue to maintain close co-operation with our regional counterparts to stem the inflow of drugs into Singapore. In line with the recommendations[2] of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs released in June this year, CNB will also enhance its Preventive Drug Education (PDE) efforts to spread anti-drug messages and engage youths, especially at the post-secondary level, in the fight against drugs. CNB will also work closely with our partners and key stakeholders to reach out to the general public.

In the early hours of 13 August 2015, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8.  A local suspected drug trafficker was believed to be awaiting a fresh consignment of drugs at that location.  At about 5.45am, CNB officers noticed a white Malaysia-registered lorry arriving in the vicinity.  
A short while later, CNB officers spotted the suspected drug trafficker, a 46-year-old male Singaporean, approach the left-side of the lorry and handed over a plastic bag to one of the passengers in the lorry.  The 46-year-old male was spotted receiving four plastic bags in return.  Both parties went their separate ways thereafter.
CNB officers tailed the suspected drug trafficker to a coffeeshop in the vicinity and arrested him shortly thereafter.  The four plastic bags were found to contain eight cabbages in which eight bundles of heroin were concealed within [see photos below].

At about 6.45am, the Malaysia-registered lorry was stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint and three suspected drug couriers – a 32-year-old, a 28-year-old and a 25-year-old, all male Malaysians – were placed under arrest.  Cash of S$18,500 was found within a plastic bag placed behind the driver’s seat.

Investigations into the drug activities of the four men are ongoing.  If convicted, the four may face the death penalty.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.  
CNB is committed to keeping the streets of Singapore safe from drugs.  CNB will remain vigilant to the methods which drug syndicates employ to smuggle their deadly wares into Singapore and act to intercept the drugs before they flow onto the streets.

On 3 August 2015, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) mounted an operation that crippled the activities of a drug syndicate. In this operation, a 38-year-old Singaporean male, who is the suspected syndicate leader, was arrested together with two suspected drug traffickers. About 2.3kg of heroin, 72g of ‘Ice’, 85g of cannabis and 13 Erimin-5 tablets were seized.  The drugs have an estimated street value of more than S$177,000. 
The suspected syndicate leader and his accomplice, a 22-year-old female Singaporean, were arrested in a unit at Yung Kuang Road.  About one kg of heroin, ‘Ice’, drug taking paraphernalia and $3,550 cash were recovered from the unit.  
Further investigations led to the arrest of another suspected drug trafficker, a 42-year-old male Singaporean, at Jurong West. Officers seized more than one kg of heroin, about 85g of cannabis, 72g of ‘Ice’ and 13 Erimin-5 tablets from the 42-year-old’s residence.

In a separate operation which was also carried out on 3 Aug, CNB arrested another suspected drug syndicate leader, two suspected drug traffickers, one accomplice and four clients. About 1.8 kg of ‘Ice’, with an estimated street value of about $324, 000, was seized in this operation. This drug syndicate was suspected to be receiving the drugs from overseas, by mail. The suspected drug traffickers would then repack the ‘Ice’ for sale in Singapore.   
The syndicate’s drug store was located in a unit in the Sengkang area. CNB officers mounted an operation in the vicinity of Compassvale Lane and arrested two suspected drug traffickers and four clients, all male Singaporeans. The six men are a 20-year-old, a 21-year-old, an 18-year-old, a 19-year-old, a 22-year-old and a 31-year-old respectively. An accomplice, a 21-year-old female Singaporean, was also arrested. 
A search of the drug store recovered about 1.5kg of ‘Ice’, and follow up investigations led to the arrest of the suspected syndicate leader, a 29-year old male Singaporean, in Jurong West. 
Investigations into the drug trafficking activities from the two separate cases are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g, and if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week, while 250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week[2].

Poly-drug Trafficker Arrested in River Valley In one of the cases in this latest island-wide operation, CNB officers arrested a suspected poly-drug trafficker who was dealing in a cocktail of controlled drugs.  On the night of 6 July 2015, CNB officers deployed in the vicinity of River Valley Close arrested a suspected drug trafficker at a carpark in the area.  A search on the 31-year-old male Singaporean recovered a small amount of ‘Ice’ and 100 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets.  The 31-year-old male was brought to the unit he rented at a private apartment in the area and within the unit, CNB officers arrested a 21-year-old female Singaporean suspected drug abuser.  A search of the female’s belongings recovered a small amount of ‘Ice’ and cannabis and two ‘Ecstasy’ tablets.   A subsequent search of the unit recovered about 58g of ‘Ice’, 80 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 10 Erimin-5 tablets, 18 LSD stamps and two improvised drug-smoking apparatus.  Investigations into the drug activities of both suspects are ongoing.     CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

On 9 July 2015 at about 6.09 am, CNB officers arrested two suspected drug runners, a 51-year-old male Singaporean and a 45-year-old male Singaporean, at the Queen Street area after they had retrieved a plastic bag containing 5 bundles of heroin weighing about 2.31 kg from a trash bin. The plastic bag containing heroin was placed there earlier by a suspected drug courier, a 43-year-old male Malaysian who came in a motorcycle. 
At about 6.29 am, CNB officers who had tailed the 43-year-old male Malaysian to his workplace at the Penjuru area moved in to place the suspect under arrest. 
From swift follow-up investigations on the two male Singaporeans arrested at Queen Street, CNB officers proceeded to arrest the syndicate leader, a 44-year-old male Singaporean, in a unit at North Bridge Road.  Another accomplice, a 48-year-old male Malaysian, was also arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint as he was attempting to leave Singapore in his lorry.
Investigations into the drug activities of the five men are ongoing.  If convicted, the five may face the death penalty.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.

Held at Suntec City Convention Centre Hall 403, the highlight of the carnival is a special 20th anniversary photo and timeline exhibition showcasing how the community and government have worked together since 1995 to raise awareness about the dangers of drugs and to rally support for the anti-drug cause. 
The carnival is also held in conjunction with DanceWorks!, a dance competition involving youth participants from schools and institutes of higher learning. Visitors can also look forward to an array of games and activities infused with anti-drug and healthy lifestyle elements. For the first time, visitors will be able to make an anti-drug pledge using their own mobile devices and see their pledge projected onto the media wall at the carnival. Members of public have until 31 July 2015 to submit an anti-drug pledge using their own devices at http://bit.ly/1Fi2Tx8. Special commemorative EZ-Link cardholders and green and white Anti-Drug Ribbon collar pins will be distributed at the carnival and selected public venues. Support the anti-drug movement by wearing the ribbon on 26 and 27 June 2015, and spreading the message to friends and families.
To reach out to more Singaporeans, CNB will be bringing the exhibits from the carnival to the community. Watch out for the roving exhibition at various community sites in July. More details will be shared closer to the date on CNB’s website. 
The anti-drug cause continues to receive strong support from the community partners. This year, CNB will partner Singapore Polytechnic’s School of Architecture & the Built Environment for the fifth year running on the campaign. Also, students from Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Interactive and Digital Media have developed a new preventive drug education mobile game application ‘Nelzon’. This was launched at the opening ceremony of the carnival this morning by Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister, Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs.
Emphasising the important role everyone plays in the anti-drug cause, Mr Masagos Zulkifli said, “All of us have a part to play in this effort – parents, educators, and most importantly, our youths themselves. Together, let us work as one community to win the fight against drugs, and work towards a drug-free Singapore.”

178,Stay Vigilant And Build a Drug Free Society For Our Children,2015-06-25,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/stay-vigilant-and-build-a-drug-free-society-for-our-children," Celebrating 50 Years of the Anti-Drug Movement in Singapore
As we celebrate SG50, let’s give thanks. Our children can grow up in Singapore, safe from the clutches of drug traffickers. This is a hard won situation. As we live the next 50 years, our youths must not forget the sacrifices of our Pioneer Generation in the anti-drug movement. We salute our frontline anti-narcotics officers, backed by strong government, committed community partners and sound anti-drug laws. 
We must defend and uphold Singapore’s zero tolerance approach against drug abuse. We want a society free from drug abuse, especially for our children. We strongly reject drug abuse and its harmful effects. We will act firmly against those who aim to profit from drug abusers. We will rehabilitate drug abusers and act firmly to deter repeat abusers. We will harness community support to stay vigilant against drug abuse. 
Vigilance Against External Threats
Each year on 26 June, we commemorate the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, also known as World Drug Day. It is timely to remind Singaporeans about the external drug threats.
Global Drug Problem
First, the drug problem is global. Unlike Singapore, some countries struggle with leadership and governance in the fight against drug abuse. Unable to control the drug situation, they focus on reducing the harms from drug addiction through drug substitution or needle exchange programmes. Some countries spend billions on drug substitution only to see drugs deaths rising. In Singapore, we saw for a brief period, how subutex was used to treat heroin addicts. The number of heroin addicts appeared to fall, but in fact, more became addicted to subutex. 
Singapore believes in harm prevention, and therefore, takes a zero tolerance approach against drugs. This has worked well for us. Our children can grow up in a relatively drug-free Singapore. Unfortunately, “harm reduction” has undermined society’s stance against drug abuse, and pop culture has increased society’s appetite for drugs, especially among the young. The world drug market is targeting our children as its customers. With easy travel and online influence, the minds of our young may be swayed first by pro-drug propaganda, tolerance of drugs thereafter, and ultimately, by drug abuse itself. With our drug situation under control, every Singaporean has a stake in this anti-drug cause to be aware of the global trends that threaten to undermine our children’s future.
Pro-Drug Lobby
Second, the pro-drug lobby is gaining momentum. Harm reduction has paved the way for proponents of decriminalization where penalties for drug abuse are rolled back. The final goal will be liberalization where there are no penalties whatsoever for drug abuse. This is already happening in some countries, starting with cannabis. In Singapore, we are starting to see a trend of cannabis abusers who are younger and from affluent backgrounds. 
Obsessive and profit-driven pro-drugs lobbies have lined up celebrities and headline entrepreneurs to promote drugs, with well-orchestrated public relations and online campaigns. They exaggerate claims and couch politically correct arguments that the ‘war on drugs’ has failed and that drug addiction is an illness. Why? They want to lobby for drugs to be decriminalised or worse, be legalised. The motive is money.
Rallying the Anti-Drug Movement
The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) is honoured to have participated in the Drug Task Force. Co-chaired by Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Second Minister for Home Affairs and Ms Sim Ann, Minister of State for Education, the Task Force focused on tackling the problem of young drug abusers.
Recognising that the drug problem is global and that the pro-drug lobby needs to be countered, NCADA is inviting like-minded civil society organisations and government agencies to the inaugural Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs (APFAD) in August 2015. NCADA hopes that APFAD participants will return home and rally local support for the anti-drug movement. This is critical as nations gear up for the coming UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) in 2016 where the global legal conventions on drugs will be reviewed. The anti-drug movement must make its voice heard, supported by people united across the globe, to counter the pro-drug lobby.
A Drug Free Society for Our Children
If we do not rally the anti-drug movement, we will be overtaken by global trends and the pro-drug lobby. However good our domestic drug situation, it is on borrowed time unless we make a firm stand as responsible members of society.
If we are bystanders, the consequences will be disastrous. The enormous profits from marketing and selling of drugs to our children will be an onslaught if we act too late.
Already, in countries where drugs have been decriminalised or legalised, much money has been spent to promote drugs in the form of candy, cakes and ice cream – clearly targeted at children and youth. It is a matter of time before social resistance against drugs becomes another endangered species. 
Let us stop to think how we would feel if our children could buy cannabis candy or ice cream at a local shop or if our children’s teachers are drug abusers. When confronted with such scenarios, many who argued in favour of the pro-drug lobby had to pause. It never hits home until your own home is hit.
I have met former drug abusers. They became drug-free after rehabilitation. The so-called friends who first enticed them into the evil trap said drugs were not addictive. These were lies. Former drug abusers can tell us honestly - drugs are harmful and addictive. They just could not escape. 
Now that they have, they regret their past, but value their future even more.
Now that they know, they tell me to keep children away from drugs.
They should know better than I.
Do you?
 
 Help us build a drug free society for your children.

He was accompanied by a 20-year-old male Malaysian pillion rider.
In the course of checks, a checkpoint officer observed an unusual bulge under the motorcyclist’s clothes. Officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) conducted further checks and uncovered a total of four blocks of substances, suspected to be cannabis, strapped to the subjects’ backs and groin areas. 
Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were immediately alerted of the detection. The motorcyclist, the pillion rider and the blocks were handed over to CNB for further investigations. The seized blocks were found to contain a total of about 1.9 kg of cannabis, worth an estimated street value of about S$62,000. 
Investigations on both subjects are ongoing.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, those convicted of importing more than 500g of cannabis may face the death penalty.  1.9kg of cannabis is enough to sustain the drug habit of about 270 cannabis abusers for a week.
Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security, and security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  The Home Team agencies will continue to conduct checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

There was a female passenger in the taxi.
In the course of inspection, ICA officers uncovered a bag placed under the front passenger seat of the vehicle. Upon closer examination, the officers found seven bundles wrapped with black tape. Suspecting the bundle to contain controlled drugs, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were immediately alerted of the detection. The 52-year-old male driver, the 37-year-old female Malaysian passenger and the bundles were handed over to CNB for further investigations.
The seized bundles were found to contain a total of about 1.4kg of heroin, about 149g of ‘Ice’,140 tablets of Ecstasy and 100 Erimin 5 pills. The total estimated street value of the drugs amounts to about S$129, 500.
Investigations on both subjects are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week. 
Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security, and security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  The Home Team agencies will continue to conduct checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

           International celebrity Jackie Chan made a special appearance at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) today as Singapore’s new anti-drug ambassador. He joined Guest-of-Honour Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister, Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs at the launch of a new anti-drug mobile game application called Aversion.
 

         Aversion is developed by students from NYP’s School of Interactive and Digital Media.  In this game, players aim to avoid contact with drugs and learn of the harm that different drugs can cause. The message is clear - to advance in life, avoid drugs at all times. “This collaboration with CNB has given our students the opportunity to play a part in educating their peers about the dangers of drug abuse”, said Mr Daniel Tan, Director of NYP’s School of Interactive & Digital Media.
 
         Minister Masagos said, “We all have a part to play in the fight against drugs. Everyone has a responsibility to spread the anti-drug message. We do not want to see lives lost to drugs and families broken up as a result of drugs. Drugs have no place in our society.”
 
         “Younger people increasingly see drugs as a ‘personal choice’. The reality is, drugs are addictive and harmful to both the mind and body. You cannot experiment with drugs and not expect to get hooked. The only choice is to stay away from drugs”, said Singapore’s new anti-drug ambassador Mr Jackie Chan.

Launch of Anti-drug Mobile Game Application


It is my pleasure to join you today to launch a new preventive drug education (PDE) mobile game application in Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). The launch at NYP has special significance because the new mobile game, named‘Aversion’,is developed by students from NYP’s School of Interactive and Digital Media.
 
This game is based on the concept of complete drug avoidance. In this game, players aim to avoid contact with drugs and various obstacles. Along the way, they learn of the harm that different drugs can cause. The message is clear - to advance in life, avoid drugs at all times. Always say no to drugs.

Drugs are not only Addictive, they are also Harmful

 Preventive Drug Education is our first line of defence in the war against drugs. We must build awareness and inform youths about the dangers of drugs, so that they can make the right choices to live a full life.
 
 We are concerned about the growing numbers of youth drug abusers. Over the last ten years, the number of arrested drug abusers below the age of 20, has increased by more than 10% per annum. CNB has also recently detected clusters of young drug abusers who abused drugs with friends they met in school or in their neighbourhood. Most youth abusers abuse methamphetamine (or “Ice”), cannabis or New Psychoactive Substances (or NPS). They are willing to experiment with these drugs because they think that it is not addictive and less harmful than “traditional” drugs like heroin.
 
These wrong ideas have arisen because of wrong facts put out on social media. These misperceptions are dangerous. Drugs such as Ice, cannabis, or NPS are not only addictive, they can also damage the brain, liver, kidney and other neurological functions.
 
Many of you would have read that some states in the US have decriminalised drug possession and even legalised cannabis consumption.
 
There are many stories of how these drugs have caused serious harm. Just last month, in April, it was reported in Colorado, US that a 19-year old teenager had started to act strangely and jumped out of a third-storey window without hesitation, after his mother had fed him a cannabis-laced cookie. Before that, in March, a 22-year old man also in Colorado shot himself dead after witnesses saw him eating a large amount of cannabis candies. Due to legalisation, cannabis has taken on seemingly innocuous forms in the US. This has led to fatal consequences. Do not be mistaken – cannabis is harmful and can be deadly. I urge you to continue to ‘say no to drugs’, in whatever form or package, whether in Singapore or overseas. The consequences are not worth it as you will be harming yourself, causing heart ache to your family and running afoul of the law in Singapore, even if you consume these substances overseas.
 
We all have a Part to Play
 
We all have a part to play in the fight against drugs. Everyone has a responsibility to spread the anti-drug message. We do not want to see lives lost to drugs and families broken up as a result of drugs. The Government will persist in our efforts to reach out to all stakeholders – students, parents and teachers – to encourage everyone to play a more active role in PDE efforts.
 
This new mobile game is a clear step in this direction. It has been created by youths, for youths. NYP students were involved in every process of game development, from conceptualisation to publication. They are in the best position to design a game which can engage and educate their peers. I thank NYP’s active support for the anti-drug cause and their joint collaboration with the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). I hope that all NYP students will help us spread the anti-drug message to your friends and families.
 
Introduction of Mr Jackie Chan as Singapore’s Anti-drug Ambassador
 
It also gives me great pleasure to announce Singapore’s first-ever celebrity anti-drug ambassador, international superstar, Mr Jackie Chan. Some of you may know that he has also been China’s anti-drug ambassador since 2009. Jackie Chan has lent his star power to many other worthwhile causes such as wildlife conservation, animal abuse, and child trafficking.
 
Despite his very busy work schedule, Jackie devotes a tremendous amount of time and effort to philanthropic causes. When I first met him and asked him to lend his support to Singapore’s anti-drug efforts, he agreed without any hesitation.
 
I hope that he can inspire our youths to always say no to drugs. I also hope his presence inspires and reminds all of us that we each have the power to speak up and say no to drugs.
 
Conclusion
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, Singapore has managed to keep the drug situation under control and save Singaporeans from the harm of drug abuse. We are able to do so, not just because of our tough laws and effective enforcement, but also because we have a community that is willing and able to help us in this fight against drugs. Let us continue to keep our streets and youths safe from drugs.
 
I wish you a pleasant afternoon ahead. Thank you.

CNB Workplan Seminar 2015
Strengthening Our CNB Core, For A Future-Ready CNB

Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, CNB
CNB Officers
Government and Non-Government Partners
 
          I am pleased to be here with all of you today at the CNB Annual Workplan Seminar 2015.
 
Overview of Drug Situation
 

           As we plan for the year ahead, let us first take stock of the drug situation today. I will highlight three major trends that will have an impact on our fight against drugs: 
     

   First, the significant increase in drug supply both globally and regionally. We need to continually be on guard against drug inflows, either for transhipment or for import to Singapore. 
 
   Second, many countries have been unable to keep drug abuse in check. They have given up the fight, and are trying to solve the downstream effects of drug abuse by adopting harm reduction measures. Others have legalised cannabis consumption to alleviate prison overcrowding.
 
   Third, in Singapore, younger drug abusers below the age of 30 now make up a larger proportion of drug abusers arrested, with more abusing cannabis and coming from institutions of higher learning. These trends are indicative of the misperceptions that our youths have towards drugs. Based on our preliminary findings from focus group discussions with youths, more seem willing to experiment with drugs, especially when they are overseas and think that they are beyond the reach of our laws. Many also think that cannabis is a “soft drug”, based on what they read on social media.  


 
Zero-Tolerance Against Drugs
 
           Against this backdrop, it is crucial that we retain society’s support of our zero-tolerance stance against drugs. Zero-tolerance means that we strongly reject the scourge of drugs and do not condone its presence in our society. We tackle both drug supply and drug demand, taking a tough stance against those who wish to profit from drug trafficking. At the same time, we rehabilitate those who consume drugs, while taking firm action against repeat abusers.
 
           Our tough laws and effective enforcement have kept our streets free from drugs. They deter organised crime syndicates from producing drugs in Singapore, and keep drug abuse low. 
 
Singaporeans enjoy these benefits and strongly support our policies. We must retain the community’s trust and support and continue working towards a drug-free Singapore. 
 
           We must also ensure that the next generation understands the significance of zero-tolerance, supports it, and does not fall prey to drugs. I currently co-chair, with MOS Sim Ann, a Task Force on Youths and Drugs which was set up to tackle the youth drug abuse problem head-on. We will release the Task Force’s findings and recommendations later this year.  
 
CNB’s Role in Education, Enforcement and Engagement 
 
           CNB plays a crucial role in our fight against drugs. CNB enforces our tough drug laws and supervises drug offenders after their release from rehabilitation centres and prisons. However, CNB’s work in education and engagement is just as critical. Indeed, CNB is more than just a law enforcement agency. I’m glad that your new mission and vision statements reflect this. I hope all CNB officers commit the new mission and vision to heart. The new mission and vision are also appropriate, given the theme of this year’s workplan seminar, “Strengthening Our CNB Core, For A Future-Ready CNB”. Even as CNB strives towards operational excellence today, CNB need to look ahead and aim to be future-ready in its education, enforcement, and engagement efforts. 
 
 
Education
 
           Given that CNB officers are at the frontlines in the fight against drugs, they also play a critical role in the area of Preventive Drug Education or PDE. CNB officers must reach out to and mobilise the community to support and advocate our clear stand against drug abuse. Our top priority must be to protect and save our youths from drugs, and quickly and decisively correct any misperceptions on drugs. We must reach out to youths and help them understand that “soft drugs” do not exist and that drug use is never one-off. CNB officers know, first hand, the misery and tragedies that drug abusers and their families experience. Hence, all of you here can share this message and stories with great credibility and conviction. 
 
           PDE is not new to CNB.  For many years now, CNB has been reaching out to primary and secondary schools. Those outreach efforts have been good, but we need to expand our PDE efforts to students in ITE, polytechnics and universities, as well as to NSFs. We have to regularly review the PDE content to ensure it remains relevant and engaging, and to find new and effective ways to reach out to youths. The issue of drug abuse by itself may be unfamiliar or seem irrelevant to youths, as not many will encounter such issues in their daily lives. The challenge is to overcome youths’ apathy towards anti-drug messages. 
 
We will also need to broaden our PDE outreach to parents, educators, and school counsellors to raise their awareness of the symptoms and risks of drug abuse. They are our valuable PDE partners. Effective early intervention is possible only when we work together with them to detect and discourage drug abuse. 
 
Enforcement
 
           On enforcement efforts, we must continue to be on top of emerging drug trends. I am glad that CNB has kept a close watch on music events, following the deaths of several youths and young adults from suspected drug overdose at such concerts in the region last year. Another trend that we should continue to monitor is that of youths experimenting with drugs when they are overseas, as they think they are beyond the reach of our laws. CNB performs checks at our various checkpoints, including the airport, and has taken action against individuals found to have consumed drugs overseas. We will work with the Institutes of Higher Learning to remind our youths when they go overseas for exchange programmes or overseas study trips, not to experiment with drugs and to say no to drugs.
 
       We will also ensure that our laws remain relevant to deal with the evolving drug threat. New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are difficult to regulate as new varieties are constantly being created to circumvent laws. 
 
In 2014, CNB classified 10 groups of NPS as well as 39 individual NPS as Class A controlled drugs, alongside heroin and cannabis. This means that the trafficking, possession or consumption of these NPS is illegal. On 1 May, CNB classified 14 more NPS as controlled drugs, as well as temporarily restricted the circulation of 18 other NPS.
 
       One of these 18 NPS, also known as “Spice”, has been linked to several deaths in the United States. We need to ensure that such substances are not circulated in Singapore and keep the NPS situation in Singapore under control. The hundreds of varieties of these NPS, with new formulations every month, mean that we must always be on the lookout for new variations of drugs. 
 
 
Engagement
       On the engagement front, we need to engage and work with like-minded partners, both foreign and local, who share our concerns about drugs. This is especially so given the robust debate expected on drug control policies at the upcoming UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem in 2016. The 36th meeting of the ASEAN Senior Officials on Drug Matters, which Singapore is hosting in August this year, will be a good platform for us to strengthen our united ASEAN voice against drugs. 
 
       Also in August, the National Council Against Drug Abuse will be organising the inaugural Asia-Pacific Forum Against Drugs. The forum will be a useful platform for Singapore to engage like-minded NGOs and government agencies, and exchange ideas in dealing with the scourge of drugs. 
 
Strengthening the CNB Core
 
.       For CNB to perform all these roles effectively – in education, enforcement and engagement – CNB has to continually strengthen its core. Even with the increase in resources that will be made available to MHA, CNB needs to continue to develop its officers to their fullest, use technology and systems effectively and take community partnerships to the next level. 
 
       First, CNB officers must be well-rounded and versatile. Officers have to be able to perform a variety of roles, work effectively with other Home Team Departments and with their overseas counterparts. This will also put them in a good position to counter the rapidly evolving modus operandi of drug abusers and traffickers.
 
       Next, CNB must leverage technology to do the things that technology does better so that our officers can be deployed in areas where their instincts and judgement are critical. 
 
For example, once CNB fully implements the application of Business Analytics to manage drug supervisees, it will be able to design and calibrate supervision cycles for abusers based on risk profiles, rather than on drug antecedents alone. This allows CNB officers to focus their attention on higher-risk supervisees. Supervisees are also incentivised to abide by their regimes and work towards reducing their reporting frequency. The same benefits also apply when CNB emplaces more low-risk supervisees on the hair supervision scheme, which has a lower reporting frequency than urine supervision. This is possible now that CNB have developed hair analysis protocols for drugs other than opiates, including methamphetamine, cannabis, and ketamine. Overall, these changes enhance our productivity, without compromising our effectiveness. 
 
       Finally, we must take community partnerships to the next level. DPM Teo and I both spoke about this during the recent Committee of Supply debates. Tackling drugs is a job that we cannot do alone. We believe that people are innately willing to help others and do their part for the community. Hence, CNB must find ways to enable and link our community partners up to strengthen support for the work that CNB does and amplify our PDE footprint. One example was CNB’s collaboration with Nanyang Polytechnic to organise the Singapore Games Creation Competition 2014 based on an anti-drug theme. The top entries have been uploaded on the competition website and CNB is exploring bringing some of them, which are designed by youths, for youths, to the mobile platform for greater outreach.
 
Conclusion
 
       Ladies and Gentlemen, in March, we went through a period of National Mourning following Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s passing. I thank all CNB officers who took part, in one way or another, in the events of that week. As you carry out your duties as CNB officers, remember that your vision of a drug-free Singapore is critical to our broader MHA vision of keeping Singapore safe and secure. This is an important foundation on which Mr Lee built our nation. Just as Mr Lee and our pioneer generation of leaders constantly planned ahead for the future, we need to stay vigilant and be alert to changes in drug trends. CNB’s efforts have kept our streets largely free from drugs and our children safe from drugs. Let us keep it that way, through upstream education, effective enforcement, and engagement of strategic partners. 
 
       I look forward to continue working with all of you as we strive to make Singapore a drug-free society. I wish all of you a fruitful workplan seminar ahead. Thank you.   

 
  
SPEECH BY MR NG SER SONG, DIRECTOR CNB, FOR CNB WORKPLAN SEMINAR 2015, AT POLICE CANTONMENT COMPLEX, 4 MAY 2015 (MONDAY) AT 10.00AM 
 
 
Mr Masagos Zulkifli,
Minister, Prime Minister’s Office
Second Minister for Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs
Distinguished guests, Home Team colleagues and fellow officers
Good morning and welcome to CNB’s Workplan Seminar 2015. I thank you all for gracing this event.
 
Looking back on 2014 – Key Achievements
 

           In 2014, CNB has maintained the intensity of our enforcement efforts. We arrested 3,085 drug abusers, conducted 52 major operations, including 20 island-wide operations, taking out 21 drug syndicates. 108 joint sectoral operations were conducted with Police land divisions and 1,747 joint operations with ICA. On the last day of 2014, with ICA’s help, we managed to seize nearly 9.3kg of heroin at Woodlands Checkpoint, the largest haul uncovered in 2014. 
 
           In February this year, we arrested a Singapore drug syndicate leader in Johor Bahru. The syndicate was responsible for supplying about 4.5kg of heroin, 500g of Ice and 1kg of cannabis per week to local drug traffickers. We have worked over a two years period, with Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (NCID) of the Royal Malaysian Police, to build up the case. The success of this prolonged operation was not measured only by the magnitude of the disrupted drug operations, but also the resources and confidentiality that both agencies have committed to in building up the case. It shows the close cooperation between NCID and CNB in tackling cross-border drug syndicates. 
                 
CNB’s Operating Environment and Challenges
 
           As the case shows, drug trafficking activities are transnational in nature. Singapore is also not a drug-producing country and our supply of drugs come from overseas. 
 
           The regional drug situation is worsening. Opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar and Laos rose last year. More drug manufacturing and processing labs have appeared in the region. Syndicates also continue to target countries in the region as destination and transit countries. The unfavourable regional drug situation will likely increase the potential spill-over supply of drugs into Singapore, which poses a significant threat to us. 
 
           On the demand side, two-thirds of the new abusers arrested last year are below the age of 30. The educational profile of abusers arrested is also changing, with more from institutions of higher learning. 
 
CNB’s New Vision and Mission Statements
 
           The environment that we operate in has become, and will continue to be more complex and challenging. As our operating environment evolves, we must respond strategically. Even more critical, we need to invest in the future to prepare us for what lies ahead. To this end, the Bureau has involved our CNB officers in a re-visioning exercise last year to co-create a Vision and Mission, one which officers could identify with in light of the many developments over the past decade. Through the many conversations that we have had over the past year, officers have expressed strong support for CNB’s mandate to keep Singapore drug-free. The Bureau’s values of professionalism, integrity, dedication and courage continue to resonate strongly with our officers. 
 
           Today, we unveil our new Vision and Mission statements. These statements underscore every CNB officer’s commitment to build a drug-free Singapore.
 
           Our new Vision “A Singapore without drugs, where everyone can live, work and play safely”. To this end, the greater outcome that we hope to achieve would be to create a safe and secure home for Singaporeans where drugs would not be easily available, and where their sense of safety and security would not be threatened by the presence of drug abusers and pushers in the streets.
 
       On this note, I would like to share a quote from the Enforcement Divisional Planning Seminar (DPS) by our officers – “If we were to realise this dream, we are making great progress for the society as a whole. Even if it feels impossible, that is the right direction CNB should be heading.” Indeed, our new Vision statement is more than just a strong mandate; it is an ambitious and noble calling that I hope all of us will meet with gusto and work towards achieving that greater goal together.
 
       We have traditionally been focused on vigorous and tough enforcement against drug offenders. I was heartened to hear from many officers during the re-visioning exercise that we should take on a more proactive role in engaging our strategic partners - To do more in preventive education and to maintain the international space on our zero-tolerance against drugs. 
 
       Our new Mission is “To Enforce, Educate and Engage, for a drug free Singapore”. The new mission statement represents CNB’s twin strategies of demand and supply reduction in three areas - Enforcement, Education and Engagement. Let me elaborate further on these areas. 
 
Enforcement
 
       As a law enforcement agency, rigorous anti-drug enforcement continues to be a key focus of our work. While we enforce through the use of intelligence, operations and investigations, the development of robust laws and policies to guide enforcement are equally important. One key aspect of effective enforcement is the forging of close collaborations with our Home Team, local and international partners to keep drugs off Singapore streets.  
 
 
Education
 
       Preventing the abuse of drugs is another key aspect of CNB’s work. As Minister Masagos has highlighted earlier, preventive education will be the cornerstone to curtail the next generation of drug abusers. We will need preventive education to inform the community on the harms of drugs and strengthen the resilience of our youths to stay away from drugs. 
 
       It is important for us to press on with our enforcement efforts, as well as continue to communicate our anti-drug messages clearly and in an engaging manner that resonates with youths. To arm them with facts is a means to protect our youths from drugs. 
 
Engagement
 
       This brings me to the third part of our Mission – the importance of active engagement, both with our local and with our international partners, to create a Singapore without drugs. 
 
       To reach out to the local community on drug matters, we leverage on Police community engagement platforms. For example, our officers from Enforcement F Division work closely with its Police counterparts to reach out to the Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) Chairman twice a year, to update them on the latest drug trends and foster closer relationship with the grassroots leaders. Enforcement G Division also works with Police D Division in the ""We STRIVE"" programme which aims to address youth delinquency. We have also leveraged on the Police-CNB-Schools-MSF (PCSM) Liaison Framework to work with key partners in the outreach to at-risk youths and students. 
 
       To make PDE activities more appealing to our young target audience, we have been collaborating with students from Singapore Polytechnic since 2011 to conceptualise and organise outreach activities to commemorate the World Drug Day.   
 
       On the international front, as Second Minister Masagos has highlighted earlier, we need to garner the support of other jurisdictions who share our zero-tolerance stance, through international meetings and bilateral exchanges. We should engage them now, to fight back against the global wave of liberal attitudes towards drug taking.
 
Living out the CNB Values
 
       I have shared the challenges that the Bureau will face in the future. It is during these times of uncertainty and change that we should re-examine our core values. These values will serve as critical anchors to guide our actions as individuals, shape our corporate instincts and motivate and inspire us towards our Vision. Our values are the glue that binds us together, not just in what we do, but how we go about doing it as a Bureau. 
 
       The current set of CNB Values was developed back in 2001 but they are as relevant today as when they were first introduced. For operations, we need courageous and dedicated officers who are equipped to respond to any situation professionally. In crafting policies, we need knowledgeable and professional officers who are able to weigh the tradeoffs of our policies and the impact on Singaporeans, before making the best recommendation for our anti-drug policies. In preparing for the future, we need innovative officers to develop planning capabilities and harness the use of technology and science. Regardless of our job functions, every one of us should strive to live out our Values when carrying out our duties. 
 
Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew
 
       As we look towards the future, we have to remember lessons from the past and remain steadfast to our convictions. The efforts of our founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his pioneer team did not come about by chance. Singapore’s success was achieved through careful planning and execution by our pioneer leaders, underpinned by values of incorruptibility, integrity, and the resolve to stand by the fundamentals of law and order. These ultimately led to the safe and secure Singapore that we all enjoy and live in today. 
 
       During the period of National Mourning, I have witnessed how CNB and fellow Home Team officers were undeterred by the adverse conditions around us. From queuing up under the hot sun to pay respects to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew Lying in State, to lining the route outside Police Cantonment Complex in the rain as the funeral procession passed, our officers have maintained an image of professionalism. Our officers also helped to maintain law and order during the lining of street. Despite the additional responsibilities, we did not let up on our efforts to keep Singapore free from drugs. I would like to take this opportunity to thank officers for the dedication and service rendered during this challenging period. 
 
       I hope that we will maintain this spirit of perseverance as we work towards our Vision of a drug-free Singapore. Our achievements today did not occur by chance. We have come so far because officers past and present were committed to the mandate to keep Singapore drug-free. They have worked tirelessly to eradicate rampant drug crime right from the start. 
 
Conclusion
       Let us hold on to our values, remain committed to our Mission, and strive to keep Singapore drug-free for our loved ones, our children, and our future generations. To my officers, I urge all of you to continue to do your good work to build a strong CNB Core that will propel us forward as one to keep Singapore drug-free.
        On this note, I want to thank our guests for taking the time to be here with us today and I look forward to a fruitful discussion with officers later.

189,MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT,2015-04-30,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/misuse-of-drugs-act1," MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT
 
With effect from 1 May 2015, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all 14 psychoactive substances currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), in the First Schedule of the same Act. This means that these substances will be reclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). In addition, a new psychoactive substance, commonly known as AH-7921, will also be listed in the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B).
At the same time, 18 new substances will be listed in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex C).
Background
There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] across the globe. Based on the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime World Drug Report 2014, there are at least 450 NPS identified in 2014, a significant increase from the 2009 figure of 126[2]..
Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use and their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. Although there is currently only a small number of abusers arrested for NPS abuse in Singapore, this is a necessary pre-emptive move to restrict the circulation of these harmful substances in our community.
Following the listing of the 15 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.

Retrieved on 16 Apr 2015 from https://www.unodc.org/LSS/Announcement/Details/4fa8b728-dd76-4c3f-b2c5-f645ed05add3  MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT   With effect from 1 May 2015, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all 14 psychoactive substances currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), in the First Schedule of the same Act. This means that these substances will be reclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). In addition, a new psychoactive substance, commonly known as AH-7921, will also be listed in the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B). At the same time, 18 new substances will be listed in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex C). Background There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] across the globe. Based on the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime World Drug Report 2014, there are at least 450 NPS identified in 2014, a significant increase from the 2009 figure of 126[2].. Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use and their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. Although there is currently only a small number of abusers arrested for NPS abuse in Singapore, this is a necessary pre-emptive move to restrict the circulation of these harmful substances in our community. Following the listing of the 15 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.   CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

NCID officers also raided the fugitive’s “drug store” and residence in Malaysia and seized a total of about 580g of heroin, 370g of ‘Ice’, 350g of ketamine, 150 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 4,450 Erimin-5 tablets and cash of RM48,280.  
The syndicate is believed to have been coordinating a drug supply chain, supplying mainly heroin and ‘Ice’ to Singaporean drug traffickers.  Other drugs trafficked by the syndicate included ‘Ecstasy’, ketamine, Erimin-5 and cannabis.  
Ongoing investigations and disruption of syndicate activities since December 2012
CNB started investigations into the trafficking activities of the syndicate in December 2012. Between December 2012 and February 2015, CNB launched a series of operations to disrupt the drug trafficking activities of the syndicate. In total, CNB had launched 14 operations, resulting in the arrest of 40 drug offenders and seizure of about 8kg of heroin, about 1.7kg of “Ice”, about 1.9kg of cannabis and other drugs. Details of some of these operations are in Annex A.
Close cooperation with NCID
The successful dismantling of the drug syndicate headed by the Singaporean fugitive is a testament of the close cooperation between CNB and NCID in tackling cross-border drug trafficking syndicates. This Malaysia-based syndicate is believed to be capable of supplying about 4.5kg of heroin, about 500g of “Ice”, about 1kg of cannabis and other controlled drugs into Singapore per week. 4.5kg of heroin and 500g of “Ice” could feed the addiction of about 2,100 heroin addicts and 280 “Ice” addicts per week.
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “The successful conclusion of the protracted investigation against this drug syndicate is a result of the firm resolve and commitment of CNB and NCID to take down drug syndicates. Drug syndicates operate with no respect for national borders.  I would like to extend my appreciation to my NCID counterpart, Acting Director Dato’ Haris Wong, for NCID’s partnership to dismantle this syndicate which is responsible for trafficking in large quantities of drugs. CNB will continue to collaborate with our regional counterparts to tackle the drug scourge to stop the flow of drugs, both upstream and at street level.”

On 23 July 2013, a then 51-year-old male Singaporean suspected drug trafficker was arrested.  About 370g of ‘Ice’, 470g of ketamine and 1,796 Erimin-5 tablets were seized from the operation.  
In an operation launched on 29 June 2014, CNB officers arrested a total of four suspected drug offenders.  A sizeable amount and variety of drugs were seized from this operation - about 600g of cannabis, 160g of ketamine, 20g of ‘Ice’, 2,180 Erimin-5 tablets and 188 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets.
On 23 September 2014, CNB launched an operation which saw the arrest of four suspected drug offenders.  From this operation, a total of about 5.5kg of heroin, 1kg of cannabis, 11g of ‘Ice’, and small amounts of ‘Ecstasy’ and Erimin-5 tablets were seized.  
On 30 October 2014, four suspected drug offenders were arrested in an operation which saw another sizeable amount of drugs seized.  From this operation, a total of about 450g of heroin, 210g of ‘Ice’, 1,000 Erimin-5 tablets and 22 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets were seized.

 On 4 February 2015, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and the Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (NCID) of the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) launched an operation to apprehend a 46 year-old suspected Singaporean drug syndicate leader believed to be supplying heroin and ‘Ice’ to drug traffickers in Singapore.  The arrest of the 46 year-old suspected drug syndicate leader is the culmination of a two-year long investigation by CNB, jointly with NCID, to dismantle a drug trafficking syndicate. The syndicate was based in Malaysia. The suspected syndicate leader was wanted by Singaporean authorities and was in hiding in Malaysia.  In coordinated action between NCID Bukit Aman, NCID Johor and CNB, the Singaporean fugitive and his drug associates were earlier arrested in Johor Bahru, Malaysia on 4 February 2015 by NCID officers.

197,CNB maintains enforcement efforts in 2014,2015-01-26,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/cnb-maintains-enforcement-efforts-in-2014," The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested a total of 3,158 drug abusers in 2014, a decrease of 12% from the 3,581 drug abusers arrested in 2013. The number of new drug abusers arrested in 2014 was 1,093, a 2% drop from 2013 when 1,110 new abusers were arrested. However, the proportion of new drug abusers has increased over 2013.  About two-thirds of the new drug abusers were below 30 years of age.
Heroin and methamphetamine (or ‘Ice’) remained the two most commonly abused drugs, with about 92% of all drug abusers arrested having abused one or the other. Cannabis was the third most commonly abused drug in Singapore. While most abusers arrested generally abused one drug type, about 15% (or 478) of abusers arrested in 2014 were poly-drug abusers i.e. they consumed more than one drug type. The combination of heroin and methamphetamine was the most common among poly-drug abusers.
CNB continued with its intensive enforcement efforts to prevent drugs from entering and making their way to the streets of Singapore.  In 2014, CNB conducted 52 major operations, including 20 island-wide operations, taking out 21 drug syndicates.  The island-wide operations targeted middle-level drug traffickers, street-level pushers and drug abusers, and were supported by the Singapore Police Force (SPF). CNB also conducted 1,747 operations at the checkpoints with our Home Team counterparts, such as the SPF and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA).  
The drugs seized in 2014 were estimated to be worth S$8.17 million. This is approximately 60% lower than that seized in 2013. Of note however, is that cannabis seizures have increased by about 125%, from 15.57kg in 2013 to 35.03kg in 2014. While overall methamphetamine (‘Ice’) seizures decreased by about 72%, from 44.06kg in 2013 to 12.53kg in 2014, the amount of ‘Ice’ meant for the local market increased from 8.85kg to 9.18kg. The 9.18kg of ‘Ice’ is enough to sustain the addiction of about 1,200 abusers for one month.  
Preventive drug education continues to be a key focus of CNB’s strategy. We organised large-scale events such as “DanceWorks!’ and the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign to spread the anti-drug message to students and the general public. We also increased outreach to youths through various platforms such as forum-theatre style skits, roadshows and a collaboration with Nanyang Polytechnic to organise an anti-drug games creation competition for secondary schools. These outreach efforts remind youths to stay away from drugs.

of heroin to drug traffickers in Singapore. The successful operation to arrest the 30-year old was a result of the close co-operation between NCID and Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), to share intelligence and to collaborate and co-ordinate
operations to smash trans-border drug syndicates. The 30-year-old Malaysian male and 14 of his associates were arrested by NCID and a total of about 27kg of heroin and cash amounting to about RM$290,000 were seized from this operation on 2 December.
Intensive joint effort by NCID and CNB 

 During the joint investigation on the 30-year-old Malaysian drug supplier, CNB shared timely intelligence with our NCID counterpart, so as to allow NCID to conduct their investigations into the drug activities of the 30-year old Malaysian drug supplier,
    who was based in Johor. This is a testament to the close ties between CNB and NCID and the agencies’ determination to persevere together in their efforts to tackle the drug scourge afflicting both countries. 
 Through CNB’s investigations, it was found that the 30-year old Malaysian drug supplier was believed to be involved in the supplying of heroin to local drug traffickers. In conjunction with the operation conducted by NCID, CNB also conducted two
    operations on 1 December and 2 December 2016 which resulted in the arrest of three local drug traffickers and seizing a total of about 3kg of heroin[1] and 450 grams of cannabis. The haul of drugs is estimated to be more then
    S$225,000.
 Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “The fight against drugs is getting more complex by the day. However, with NCID’s close and firm support, we are confident of continuing the good fight against the drug scourge, which continues to inflict
    untold harm upon society. I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to Director NCID Dato’ Sri Mohd Mokhtar bin Hj. Mohd Shariff and NCID staff, for their strong support to CNB in this intensive enforcement and investigation

Chijioke Stephen Obioha was convicted of trafficking in 2,604.56g of cannabis and sentenced to death on 30 December 2008. The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) provides for the death penalty if the amount of cannabis trafficked is 500g or more.
Chijioke Stephen Obioha had been accorded full due process under the law. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 16 August 2010. After the amendments to the death penalty regime under the MDA came into effect on 1 January 2013, Chijioke Stephen Obioha was given the opportunity to elect to be considered for re-sentencing under the new death penalty regime. He appeared before an Assistant Registrar in the High Court on 25 February 2013, during which time he confirmed that he did not wish to be part of the re-sentencing process, and that he understood the consequences of his decision.
On 13 May 2015, Chijioke Stephen Obioha’s counsel filed a criminal motion in court for a stay of execution and to adduce fresh evidence for a review of his conviction. At the hearing of the criminal motion before the Court of Appeal on 14 May 2015, Chijioke Stephen Obioha changed his mind and elected to be considered for re-sentencing under the new death penalty regime. Although his request to adduce fresh evidence was rejected, the Court of Appeal ordered a stay of execution for Chijioke Stephen Obioha to allow him time to file an application for re-sentencing.
At the hearing on 25 August 2016, Chijioke Stephen Obioha withdrew his re-sentencing application. The Court of Appeal subsequently notified Chijioke Stephen Obioha on 12 October 2016 that the stay of execution would be lifted on 24 October 2016 unless he demonstrated by noon on 21 October 2016 to the Court of Appeal’s satisfaction that there was good reason not to do so. As Chijioke Stephen Obioha did not put any application before the Court of Appeal by the stipulated date, the Court of Appeal lifted the stay of execution on 24 October 2016.
On 16 November 2016, Chijioke Stephen Obioha’s counsel filed a criminal motion in court for a stay of execution and to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment. The criminal motion was heard and dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 17 November 2016. His sentence was carried out on 18 November 2016.
Chijioke Stephen Obioha was given the opportunity to petition the President for clemency. Both the petitions for clemency filed by him through his counsel and by the High Commission of Nigeria were turned down.

be worth more than S$210,000.
In the evening of 26 October, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Scotts Road, at a multi-storey carpark, to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker, a 41-year-old Singaporean male.  At about 7.10pm, the 41-year-old male and
a 39-year-old Malaysian male were observed to be in the vicinity.  The Singaporean male was then spotted going to his car and the Malaysian male rode off on a Malaysia-registered motorcycle.
A while later, CNB officers spotted another drug trafficker, a 42-year-old Singaporean male, arriving at the multi-storey carpark in a car with two other suspects, a 30-year-old Singaporean male and a 22-year-old Singaporean female.  After a short
while, the second drug trafficker left the carpark in his vehicle.
CNB officers arrested the 41-year-old and his female companion, a 23-year old Singaporean, in the 41-year-old’s car in the vicinity of Bideford Road.  Four bundles of heroin weighing about 1.8kg were recovered from the boot of the car. 
Another party of CNB officers apprehended the second drug trafficker in the vicinity of Devonshire Road and arrested all three suspects in the car.  A total of about 470g of heroin, 260g of ‘Ice’, 470 Erimin-5 tablets and more than 100
‘Ecstasy’ tablets were recovered from within the car.  Cash amounting to S$6,500 was recovered from him. 
Separately, the 39-year-old Malaysian male was arrested at Tuas Checkpoint.  Cash amounting to S$3,500 was recovered from the Malaysian male. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250
straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.

Honourable Ministers from ASEAN Member States,
Your Excellency Le Luong Minh, Secretary General of ASEAN,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good evening.
Introduction

 I wish you all a warm welcome to the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters (AMMD) and a warm welcome to Singapore.
 
 Let me start by first offering our collective deepest condolences to Thailand on the loss of His Majesty. I think that loss is an irreparable loss. It is not only a loss to Thailand and the people of Thailand, a deeply loved and revered monarch for
    over 70 years. It is a loss to the entire region and the region grieves with Thailand. Our deepest condolences, and I’m sure I speak for all ASEAN Member States and everyone here. 
 
 Excellencies, your presence here demonstrates your deep commitment to tackle the problem of drugs – both as individual countries, and collectively as ASEAN.
 

    Global and Regional Situation
 
 Globally, and in our region, the drug situation remains challenging. Global drug production continues to grow. Opium production is growing. Our enforcement agencies are seizing ever larger quantities of drugs. The Southeast Asian region is especially
    vulnerable. We have the Golden Triangle which is one of the world’s top producers of drugs in this region, or in the world.
 
 The Golden Triangle presents very complex challenges not only in terms of drug enforcement but also in terms of the economic situation - the poverty, crime and conflict – all of these create problems.
 
New Psychoactive Substances
 
 In addition, globally and regionally, we have an emerging trend which is the abuse of more and newer psychoactive substances. According to our estimates, about one hundred new psychoactive substances are reported every single year. This constant churn
    poses tremendous challenges because we have to identify them and put them into our legislation. As soon as we put them into our legislation and go after these drugs, something new comes up which technically is not an offence. So these are serious
    challenges that face us.
 
Drug abuse by young persons
 
 In addition, I think something that all our countries and across the world are facing is the fact that increasingly younger and younger people are getting attracted to drugs. And they are moving towards synthetic drugs which is a serious problem. They
    see drugs as cool and fashionable, they think that they are in control, that they can try it and then they can kick it. But we know what happens. They get addicted and it takes a long time to recover, many don’t. But those who wish to recover,
    it takes a long time and a lot of effort. And there is irreparable harm that is inflicted on a person’s mind and body.
 
 Here in Singapore, we have conducted research given such a trend and that people think they can try it and stop easily. There is also a suggestion that doctors are approving some drugs for medical use, which is not true. No respectable medical association
    or body of doctors in the world have come forward to say that this is something that is necessary. But at the United Nations, you get human rights organisations that say that drugs is necessary for medicine.
 
 So we got our Institute of Mental Health (IMH) experts to review the literature in the field. They went through more than 500 articles and research. The conclusion was very clear - the use of drugs like cannabis causes irreversible damage to the brain
    and it affects the thinking ability. This research is backed, there is no doubt to it. Under very carefully controlled medical situations, there may be some situations to relieve pain in the hospital, but not for consumption outside.
 
A Drug-Free ASEAN Community
 
 So if we look at it – synthetic drugs, psychoactive substances, young people taking it, production of drugs – these are all the challenges we face. The road ahead for us is not going to be easy. But as ASEAN, we have to work together.
 
 So in 2012, four years ago, the leaders of ASEAN committed ourselves to a drug-free ASEAN community. The vision that was articulated was the kind of society that we saw for our people. A vision where children can play freely in their neighbourhoods,
    where young people can live their lives to their fullest potential, people can live, work and play in a safe environment, free from drugs, addiction, anti-social behaviour, no peddling and trafficking of drugs, or damage to mind and body. We are not
    there yet, but at least we commit ourselves to this vision where we try and do something.
 
 The ASEAN position is that we will maintain a zero tolerance approach against drugs. We take this approach because we know the cost of failure is too high. If we fail, drugs will overwhelm our societies, and destroy the lives of our people.
 
 If we let drugs take root in our societies, everything that we stand for will be threatened - our families, our social stability, our security and even our very system of organising ourselves. 
 
 Along the way, we have and will continue to face a lot of international pressure to take a more relaxed approach, to be “more tolerant”. In many quarters, there have been calls to abandon this vision of a “drug-free” society
    and move towards a “drug-tolerant” one.
 
 I ask that we maintain our resolve in ASEAN and do what we know is the best for our people. Over the years, we have made significant progress. We have intensified anti-drug trafficking operations. We have successfully disrupted syndicates. We have improved
    the coordination and information flow between our drug enforcement agencies. We have established the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters as a regular platform.
 
 Earlier this year, ASEAN spoke as one united voice at the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs and again at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS). Indonesia spoke up on behalf of all of us, and each of us spoke
    as well, including myself.
 
 Our resolve against drugs has remained strong and we must keep this up.
 
New ASEAN Work Plan on Securing ASEAN Community against Illicit drugs 
 
 This 5th AMMD represents a major milestone for the ASEAN community in our fight against drugs.Tomorrow, we will come together to discuss the new ASEAN Work Plan on Securing the ASEAN Community Against Illicit Drugs.
 
 This Work Plan will set out our collective actions for the next ten years. It is a comprehensive Work Plan that will cover all aspects of our work, including prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, enforcement and cooperation among ASEAN Member States.
 
 It is good that ASEAN and AMMD has plans to conduct a mid-term review in 2020 and a final review in 2024. These reviews will check whether we are on track and what else we need to do. We have to continuously refine our approach. 
 
Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, as we come together as ASEAN Member States, let us use this opportunity to build bonds, strengthen friendships and build relationships between our agencies. Let us remain committed to achieving our vision for a drug-free ASEAN. Together,
    this vision can become a reality.
 
 Once again, I wish you a warm welcome to Singapore and let us achieve something together. 
 
 Thank you.

206,"THE 5TH ASEAN MINISTERIAL MEETING ON DRUG MATTERS SINGAPORE, 20 OCTOBER 2016 SINGAPORE COUNTRY STATEMENT BY MR AMRIN AMIN PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS",2016-10-20,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/the-5th-asean-ministerial-meeting-on-drug-matters-singapore-20-october-2016-singapore-country-statement-by-mr-amrin-amin-parliamentary-secretary-ministry-of-home-affairs," Honourable Chairman, His Excellency, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam,
Excellencies of the ASEAN Member States and the ASEAN Secretariat
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

On behalf of the Singapore delegation, I would like to welcome you once again to Singapore. We hope you have enjoyed your stay so far.
 

             ASEAN unity was clearly demonstrated when we spoke with one voice at the 59th United Nations (UN) Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) earlier this year. We were able to reinforce our views, positions and commitment for a Drug-Free ASEAN and we have to continue enhancing our collaboration to ensure ASEAN’s voice is heard.
 
The Worsening Global Drug Situation
 
             Strengthening ASEAN collaboration is especially important as the global and regional drug situations remain challenging. Opiates persist as a perennial problem in our region. Trends in the abuse of synthetic drugs are also worrying. According to the 2016 World Drug Report, global seizures of synthetic drugs have risen more than seven-fold since 1998. East and Southeast Asia account for a large proportion of this, being one of the largest and fastest growing methamphetamine markets in the world.
 
             We are also racing to keep up with the developments in the New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) market. This is a point also noted by our Malaysian and Indonesian delegates. The constant churn of NPS makes enforcement on the ground challenging. Although data collection for 2015 is still in progress, UNODC has already received reports of 75 new substances, compared with only 66 in the previous year.  
 
             We must continue to stay vigilant and we must cooperate with each other, and share our knowledge in tackling threats like NPS. We must prevent the regional drug situation from worsening, for the safety and security of our people.
 
Singapore’s Drug Situation
 
             These global trends have real and tangible implications on the well-being of our people, especially on our future generations. In Singapore, nearly 70% of the new abusers arrested in 2015 were below 30 years old. New abusers below 20 years old had increased by almost 50% compared to 2014.
 
             We are worried that our younger generation may be adopting a more casual attitude towards drugs. Some of them are experimenting with drugs such as methamphetamine, which has now overtaken heroin as the most commonly abused drug in Singapore. For new abusers, cannabis is the second most commonly abused drug. They mistakenly perceive cannabis to be less harmful and addictive. They see it glamourised in both mainstream and social media. They are curious when they see the pro-legalisation camp advocate the supposed medical benefits of cannabis, and push for the right to enjoy recreational drugs. What they may not see as clearly are the vested interests of these lobby groups to legitimise a lucrative industry.  
 
             Experts at the Singapore Institute of Mental Health conducted an extensive literature review in 2015 on cannabis. They came to three conclusions. First, cannabis is harmful. Second, cannabis is addictive. And third, there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness for medical cannabis, especially given the number of other viable treatments that already exist. Long-term cannabis use is associated with brain volume reduction and irreversible brain changes that lower IQs and conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder. This is not what we want for our children. We have a responsibility to safeguard their futures, so they can live their lives to the fullest potential, and not throw it away for temporary highs.
 
The Importance of Preventive Drug Education
 
             Our first line of defence is preventive drug education. We want to reach out to our youths to help educate them on the harms of drug abuse and build their resilience against drugs. We set up a Task Force on Youth and Drugs in 2015 to enhance our efforts on this front. As part of the Task Force recommendations, we stepped up our engagement of older youths above the age of 16. This is a group that is young enough to be susceptible to peer influence, yet old enough to find means to obtain drugs if they wanted to.
 
         To ensure our messages resonate with the youths, we have to tailor our approach to ensure our messages are relevant.
     

   First, we have adapted our messages to present our youths with the hard facts and evidence, so they can have a better understanding of the harms of drug abuse.
 
   Second, youths are active on social media. So we have also stepped up our engagement on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube; and we are also now on Snapchat.
 
   Third, parents, educators and third-party advocates. They all play a role in reaching out more effectively to the youths. We have developed a Preventive Drug Education Toolkit for parents and educators, and we are also building an Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy Network (A3) in our communities. These are individuals who value our drug-free society who can proactively speak up and share anti-drug messages through their own channels.


 
         There is a phrase popular among youths these days. They say “YOLO”, meaning “You only live once”. This is exactly what we need to help them realise. They must recognise that living their lives to the fullest does not mean trying drugs to satisfy their curiosity. It means going drug-free so that they can lead healthy, meaningful and joyful lives. It means being empowered to carve out their futures, rather than being enslaved by addiction.
 
Enforcement and Rehabilitation
 
         Aside from preventive drug education, we have also enhanced our enforcement efforts. We enhanced our laws in 2013 to impose harsher penalties for those who supply drugs to the young. We recognise that drug syndicates are becoming increasingly sophisticated in evading detection and arrest. Our new Organised Crime Act came into force in June this year. It strengthens our abilities to tackle organised crime, from the street-level members of drug syndicates to the highest tier of leaders who mastermind or finance these activities. We want to detect, disrupt and dismantle these organisations, as well as deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.
 
         Beyond strong prevention and enforcement, rehabilitation is also a crucial component of building a drug-free society. Ultimately, we want to save lives. When abusers come into our system, we must help them break out of the cycle of addiction and successfully reintegrate them back into society.
     

   On the youth front, we have worked with our National Addiction Management Services to introduce the Anti-drug Counselling and Engagement (ACE) Programme early this year. This is a structured rehabilitative counselling programme which equips youths with skills to cope with addiction. It will also involve their parents, who are their most important source of support and supervision.
 
   For adult abusers, we have implemented the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme which provides enhanced community support, counselling and structured supervision extending into the aftercare phase.


 
Conclusion
 
         With the mounting challenges in the global and regional drug situation, regional cooperation is more vital than ever. There is growing international debate on a new global action plan to succeed the current UN Political Declaration and Plan of Action. We must continue to push forward as a united ASEAN, to safeguard our flexibility to pursue the Drug-Free ASEAN we aspire to.
 
         Our efforts today create the societies of tomorrow. We must ensure our children do not grow up in an environment which takes drugs lightly. We must help them make the right choices in the face of all the pressures they will face. Most of all, we must help them create a safe and secure future where they are empowered to live their lives to the fullest. I urge all delegates to stay committed to the fight against drugs, as we forge ahead together for a better ASEAN.
 
         Thank you.

The Fifth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters (5th AMMD) was held on 20 October 2016 in Singapore. His Excellency Mr. Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security was the Guest of Honour at the Opening Ceremony
    of the 5th AMMD and officially opened the Meeting. The 5th AMMD was chaired by His Excellency Mr. K. Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, Singapore. The Meeting was attended by ASEAN Ministers responsible for drug matters, the
    Secretary-General of ASEAN, Heads of Anti-Drug Agencies and their respective delegations. 

The Ministers recognised significant achievements made over the past four AMMDs, which had strengthened ASEAN’s resolve against drug abuse and renewed the commitment towards the Drug Free ASEAN aspiration. The Ministers commended the ASEAN Senior
    Officials Meeting on Drug Matters (ASOD) and its five working groups for their efforts in addressing the regional drug situation. They also acknowledged the contributions made through regional cooperative mechanisms, such as the ASEAN Airport Interdiction
    Task Force (AAITF), ASEAN Seaport Interdiction Task Force (ASITF) and ASEAN Narcotics Cooperation Centre (ASEAN-NARCO), including the establishment of the ASEAN Drug Monitoring Network.

The Ministers commended ASEAN’s coordinated response at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on the World Drug Problem including at the meetings leading to the momentous event. Of significance were the joint ASEAN statements
    delivered by Singapore at the 59th Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) on 14 March 2016 in Vienna, and Malaysia at the UNGASS on the World Drug Problem on 19 April 2016 in New York. The Statements asserted ASEAN’s commitment to:
    
 Remain united in our commitment to a vision of Drug-Free ASEAN, so as to provide our people and communities with a society free from drug abuse and its ill-effects;
Supporting the centrality of the UN international drug control conventions, and the role of the CND as the principal policy-making organ;
        
Respecting the sovereign right of countries in deciding the most appropriate approaches to address their national drug situations; and
        
Promoting cooperation with other regions, as part of a larger global effort to tackle the drug problem.



The Ministers called on Member States to maintain ASEAN unity and solidarity in their participation at the UN CND and related meetings, especially during discussions on the future global drug plan that will succeed the 2009 Political Declaration and
    Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. As an expression of our unity, the Ministers launched the green-and-white Anti-Drug Abuse Ribbon, which signifies health, vitality
    and strength. Member States are encouraged to use the symbol in preventive education activities and campaigns throughout ASEAN, spreading a common message among youths and communities to be resilient against drugs.
    

The Ministers acknowledged that illicit drug production, misuse and trafficking remains a challenge for ASEAN. In this regard, they noted with appreciation Thailand’s Concept Paper proposing ASEAN Cooperation to Tackle Illicit Drug Production
    and Trafficking in the Golden Triangle. The Ministers tasked ASOD to consider the operational strategies in greater detail.

 In their statements, the Ministers also shared the following concerns:
    
Widespread misuse of illicit drugs, especially opiates and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), in our communities;
New challenges, such as the emergence of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), and diversion of precursor chemicals;
Involvement of transnational criminal syndicates in the region, especially in the manufacturing and trafficking of illicit drugs;
        
Exploitation of new technology and the region’s interconnectivity for illicit purposes;
Providing sustainable alternatives and poverty alleviation solutions for communities affected by illegal crop cultivation;
The continuing threat posed by smuggling of precursors into and the production and trafficking of illicit drugs from the Golden Triangle; and
Growing trend of trafficking of illicit drugs by sea in the region.
        



In response to these challenges, the Ministers recognised the achievements of ASOD in implementing the ASEAN Work Plan on Combating Illicit Drug Production, Trafficking and Use (2009 – 2015), which has forged closer regional cooperation and integration.
    Moving forward, the Ministers appreciated the work of ASEAN Secretariat and ASOD in developing the Post-2015 ASEAN Work Plan, and thanked Indonesia and Thailand for hosting workshops to facilitate the important discussions on the new Work Plan. 

The Ministers adopted ASEAN Work Plan on Securing Communities Against Illicit Drugs 2016 – 2025 (ASEAN Work Plan 2016 – 2025) and its regional theme. Aligned with the ASEAN Political-Security and Socio-Cultural Blueprints 2025, the ASEAN
    Work Plan 2016 – 2025 will guide Member States activities and cooperation on drug matters. The regional theme of “Securing ASEAN Communities Against Illicit Drugs” provides the motivation for ASEAN to remain resilient and committed
    to protect our people and communities from the dangers of illicit drugs. The Ministers noted that the ASEAN Work Plan 2016 – 2025 will be reviewed in 2020 (Mid-Term Review) and 2024 (Final Review), accompanied by interim internal reviews in
    2018 and 2022.

The Ministers recalled the institutionalisation of the AMMD on 27 October 2015, which raised the importance of the AMMD in providing political impetus and strategic guidance to regional efforts in combating the drug problem. To complete the institutionalisation
    process, the Ministers adopted the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters.

In keeping with the ToR, the AMMD will be held every two years, hosted on a rotational basis as per ASEAN practice. Noting that Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have hosted the AMMD, the Ministers welcomed the offer by
    Viet Nam to host the 6th AMMD in 2018.
    

In concluding, the Ministers reaffirmed ASEAN’s commitment to combat the drug problem in the region with a view to “Securing ASEAN Communities Against Illicit Drugs”

The Meeting was held in the traditional spirit of ASEAN solidarity and cordiality, in keeping with ASEAN’s journey towards a region of “One Vision, One Identity, One Community”.

113g of ketamine, 41g of cannabis, 232 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets and 97 Erimin-5 tablets.
The operation was supported by the Singapore Police Force and areas covered included Ang Mo Kio, Balestier, Bishan, Bukit Merah, Hougang, Jurong, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Senja, Tampines, Toa Payoh, Woodlands and Yishun. 
Heroin & ‘Ice’ trafficker arrested in Tampines
In one of the cases during this island-wide operation, on 4 October, CNB officers arrested a 28-year-old Singaporean male suspected drug trafficker in the vicinity of Tampines Central. Officers recovered about 90g of heroin, a small amount of ‘Ice’,
one weighing scale and numerous empty plastic packets from the man. Within the man’s residence, two suspected drug abusers – a 26-year-old female and a 29-year-old male, both Singaporeans – were arrested. Within the unit, officers
recovered about 39g of heroin and 22g of ‘Ice’. A small amount of heroin was also recovered from the 29-year-old man. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested persons are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws,
which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week[1].

On 14 September at around 4am, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Marsiling Drive to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker, a 54-year-old male Singaporean. A 43-year-old male Malaysian was spotted arriving in the area and leaving
shortly after.
CNB officers proceeded to raid the hideout of the 54-year-old male Singaporean, arresting the 54-year-old, a 49-year-old male Singaporean suspected drug associate, and a 43-year-old female Singaporean suspected drug associate. About 1.3kg of heroin was
seized from the 54-year-old and the 43-year-old. A small amount of heroin and ‘Ice’ were seized from the 49-year-old.
Meanwhile, CNB officers continued to tail the 43-year-old male Malaysian to Pasir Ris, and arrested him, seizing about 3.1kg of heroin and 125g of ‘Ice’ from his car. Follow-up investigations were conducted on the suspected intended recipient
of the drugs, a 57-year-old male Singaporean, and about 1.8kg of heroin, 3.5kg of cannabis and 150g of ‘Ice’ were recovered from his hideout in the vicinity of Compassvale Lane.
Investigations into the drug activities of all suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act allows for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g[1], if more than 500g[2]  of cannabis is trafficked, or if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g[3].
CNB has seen an increase in the seizures for ‘Ice’ and cannabis in the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year[4]. The World Drug Report 2015 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
noted that the regional drug situation continues to be challenging, with the largest methamphetamine seizures coming from East and Southeast Asia[5]. Its latest 2016 report indicated that the seizures of opiates (mainly heroin)
leaving the Golden Triangle have increased, with the quantity of seized heroin and morphine increasing from a low of 5.7 tonnes in 2008 to 13 tonnes in 2014.Regionally, drug enforcement agencies continue to see record seizures of drugs[6].
There are also increasingly liberal attitudes towards drug abuse among youths, influenced by how drug use is legitimised and decriminalised in other countries, and normalised by social media.
Amid these concerns, CNB continues to carry out sustained and intensive enforcement efforts. Mr Winston Wong, Deputy Director CNB, said, “There is much misinformation, misleading our youths into believing that drugs, especially cannabis, are not
harmful and addictive. Global developments on the cannabis front, coupled with the increasingly liberal attitudes of the young, have not escaped the eyes of drug syndicates, who are hoping to ‘cash in’ on such developments. CNB’s increased
seizures of drugs indicate the challenges that we are facing. I hope the public will continue to support our efforts and build a Drug Free Singapore with us. Singapore will be hosting the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters next
month, to discuss the challenges of the drug problem at a Ministerial level with our foreign counterparts.”

The haul of drugs seized in this operation was estimated to be
worth about S$38,000.
On 2 September 2016, officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the Changi Airfreight Centre detected a parcel believed to contain cannabis. CNB took over the parcel from ICA and conducted immediate follow-up investigations.
On 3 September 2016, the intended recipient of the parcel, a 35-year-old Singapore male, was arrested outside a HDB unit at Buangkok Crescent. A small packet of ‘Ice’ was recovered from within a bag carried by the male suspect.
CNB officers proceeded to raid the male suspect’s residence at Punggol Place. A search of the unit recovered about 13g of ‘Ice’, a small amount of heroin, a small amount of crushed Erimin-5 tablets and various improvised drug-smoking
apparatus. CNB officers also found two cannabis plants that were being cultivated and various equipment used for the cultivation of cannabis plants. A 27-year-old female Thai national was also arrested within the unit.
Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. Regardless of how controlled drugs are procured, all drug offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty for those
convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis[1]. The cultivation of the cannabis plant is also an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Any person convicted of cultivating the cannabis plant may face a
maximum of 20 years imprisonment or $40,000 fine or both. 
The Central Narcotics Bureau would like to remind the public that cannabis is a Class A controlled drug listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act. Unauthorised consumption, possession, trafficking, import or export of any Class A controlled drug is an offence.

A study done by the Task Force on Youths and Drugs in 2015 found that many young people held the view that cannabis is a ‘soft drug’, and that the harms and addictiveness of cannabis were less serious than tobacco. They cannot be more wrong.
There have also been claims made about the efficacy of cannabis as a medicine. However, such claims are inconclusive and unproven. Experts from Singapore’s Institute of Mental Health had conducted an independent literature review on cannabis,
where more than 500 articles from reputable medical journals were studied. Their findings were clear, that cannabis is harmful and addictive, especially to young people; and that half of the daily users of cannabis develop a dependence on cannabis.
Cannabis can also cause irreversible damage to a person’s brain development. Half of the daily users of cannabis develop a dependence on cannabis.

The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) collaborated with the National Library Board (NLB) to stage 16 anti-drug skits from July to December 2016, as part of the NLB’s Super Storytastic programme to encourage greater conversation between parents and
children about the dangers of drug abuse. Super Storytastic is a weekly half-hour storytelling programme held at various public libraries islandwide targeting primary school students (aged 7 to 10 years old) and their parents. 
Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr Amrin Amin attended a special performance of the anti-drug skit this afternoon alongside 50 parents and children at the Woodlands Regional Library, as actors portrayed difficult situations about children
faced with the dilemma of accepting or rejecting drugs. He also shared with parents handy tips from CNB’s anti-drug parent brochure on ways to discuss the drug issue with children. The brochure is disseminated to parents through schools and community
organisations from mid-August 2016. A softcopy of the brochure (available in four languages) is also available for download from the CNB Website (PDF, 1.23 MB).
Mr Amrin Amin said, “The Super Storytastic Programme is a great platform. I am very pleased that the CNB and NLB have worked together to use this Super Storytastic platform to talk to parents and children on the anti-drug message. It is not easy
for parents to talk to their children on drugs. But the skits were very engaging and presented the anti-drug message to children in a fun and interactive way. We are very glad for the support of the Band of Doodlers for this event. They brought so much
joy to the children by encouraging them to express their thoughts in a simple and effective way, through doodling about the anti-drug cause. We hope this event will raise greater awareness among children and their parents on the dangers of drug abuse.
We would like to urge more members of the community to join us in spreading the anti-drug message and help us achieve our vision of a Drug-Free Singapore.”

A total of about 196g of heroin,
47g of ‘Ice’ and other suspected controlled drugs were seized in this island-wide operation.
The operation was supported by the Singapore Police Force and the areas covered included Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Boon Lay, Bukit Batok, Jurong, Woodlands and Yishun. 
Operation netting two suspected drug traffickers
In one of the cases during this island-wide operation, in the afternoon hours of 16 August, CNB officers arrested a 55-year-old male suspected drug trafficker and a 44-year-old male suspected drug abuser in the vicinity of Havelock. Both are Singaporeans.
A small amount of ‘Ice’ was recovered from the 55-year-old man. 
Officers proceeded to raid the hideout of the 55-year-old man, which was also in the vicinity of Havelock. About 138g of heroin was recovered from within the unit. Numerous empty plastic straws, plastic sachets and a digital weighing scale were also recovered.
A 51-year-old male Singaporean, who is a suspected associate of the 55-year-old, was also arrested within the unit. Two other suspected drug abusers, a 29-year-old male and a 31-year-old female (both Singaporeans) were also arrested shortly after the
raid at the hideout. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested persons are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws,

In the early afternoon of 11 August, officers spotted the suspected drug trafficker meeting up with a 40-year-old male Malaysian, along Boon Teck Road. Both parted ways shortly thereafter, driving away from the area in their vehicles.
The suspected drug trafficker was tailed to the vicinity of Queenstown, where he was arrested. A search of the car recovered nearly 1.4kg of heroin, 320g of ‘Ice’, a bottle of methadone and a digital weighing scale. Cash of more
than S$600 was also recovered from the 33-year-old male.
The 40-year-old Malaysian and his spouse, a 31-year-old Malaysian, were arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint as they were attempting to exit Singapore. Cash amounting to S$7,000 was recovered from within the handbag of the female Malaysian. More
than 900 Malaysian Ringgit was also recovered from both suspects.
Another party of CNB officers raided the hideout of the suspected associate, a unit in the vicinity of Queenstown. The 49-year-old suspected associate and two suspected drug abusers – a 43-year-old male and a 37-year-old female, both Singaporeans
– were arrested within the unit. About 30g of heroin, 10g of ‘Ice’ and cash of S$3,400 were recovered from within the unit.
A total of about 1.4kg of heroin and 330g of ‘Ice’ were seized in this operation. The haul of drugs have an estimated worth of more than S$138,000.
Investigations are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about
180 abusers for a week.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Introduction
 

 I am pleased to join you today at the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign 2016. This is an annual campaign organised by the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and CNB to commemorate World Drug Day.
 
Youth Drug Abuse Situation  
 
 The number of young drug abusers has been rising over the past years at a worrying rate. In 2015, we had 1,330 abusers aged below 30, the highest that we have seen in the last decade. We expect this trend to continue this year. In the first 4 months of this year, about 6% more abusers aged below 30 have been arrested compared to the same period last year.
 
 I will speak on 3 strategies that we have to adopt to tackle this worrying trend: correcting misperceptions about drug abuse, partnering parents and educators in preventing youth drug abuse, and getting youths to take action to stay away from drugs.
 
Correcting misperceptions about drug abuse
 
 First, we need to step up efforts to correct the growing misperception about drug abuse among youths. One reason for the increase in the number of young drug abusers is the perception that it is acceptable to take drugs and that certain drugs are not harmful and not addictive. This misperception has been reinforced by how the use of drugs has been portrayed in overseas media, especially on social media. There is also misinformation about drugs, which misleads our youths into believing that drugs like cannabis could be beneficial.
 
 The truth is that drugs are harmful and addictive. The theme for this year’s Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign reinforces this point: “Drugs are addictive. Escaping is hard. Don’t Start”. The Anti-Drug Escape Game is designed to let you solve puzzles illustrating the dangers of drug abuse and its after-effects. There are no consequences if you do not complete within the time limit in the game but in that time, I hope that you will learn about the dangers of drug abuse.
 
 Drug abuse in real life is not fun. It is painful and has very real and dire consequences for the abusers and their families. One of this year’s winning entries for CNB’s Anti-Drug Video Competition, titled “Day 21”, illustrates how difficult it is for the abusers to escape from drug addiction. For every post that you see online talking about how cool drugs are, remember that you are not seeing the pain that the abuser and their loved ones are going through.
 
 Last year, we had experts in the Institute of Mental Health conduct a literature review on cannabis, where they studied more than 500 articles from reputable medical journals. Their findings were clear – cannabis is harmful and addictive, especially to young people. Half of the daily users of cannabis develop a dependence on cannabis. Cannabis also causes irreversible damage to your brain development, and even leads to a drop in IQ. The factsheet on the study[1] is available at the registration counter. I encourage you to take the factsheet, find out more about the study and distribute the factsheet to your friends. 
 
Partnering parents and educators in the preventing youth drug abuse
 
 Second, we will partner parents and educators in our fight against drug abuse. The battle against drugs cannot be fought by CNB alone. Parents and educators shape the lives and values of our youths. CNB will work with them and provide them with the knowledge and resources so that together, we will keep youths away from drugs. Many parents are surprised to hear that the profile of drug abusers is changing. Now, many young cannabis abusers come from households with middle or high socioeconomic status, and are doing academically well in school. This means that all youths are susceptible to the risk of drug abuse, and it is an issue that we have to continue to be vigilant about.
 
 We launched the Preventive Drug Education toolkit for educators and counsellors in November 2015. I am pleased to launch the Preventive Drug Education Information Brochure for parents, and toolkit for NS commanders today. The brochure and toolkit contain useful information such as tell-tale signs of drug abuse and how parents and NS commanders could help if they suspect their children or charges are abusing drugs. It also provides helplines they can call to seek assistance. The brochure contains bite-size information for easy retention and will be made available in the four main languages.
 
 We will distribute this brochure to parents through schools from July onwards. We will also work with our community partners to distribute the brochure to more parents. One such event is the Super Storytastic event. From July to December, you can bring your child down to one of the 16 Super Storytastic events at NLB’s public libraries island-wide, where you can learn about the harms of drugs through an interactive skit, and receive a copy of the anti-drug brochure.
 
 I hope that the brochure will also provide parents with an opportunity to speak to their children on the harms of drugs. Don’t wait till it’s too late. Be the anti-drug champion at home.
 
Getting youths to take action to stay away from drugs
 
 Third, we have to encourage our youths to take personal responsibility and take action to stay away from drugs. Keeping Singapore drug-free is a collective effort. While many partners are involved in our fight against drugs, our youths have a critical role in saying no to drugs. As part of this year’s campaign, we displayed Message Walls at universities and polytechnics since April and collected over 1,000 anti-drug pledges from youths. The backdrop that you see behind me today is made up of these pledges. Every pledge signifies our youths’ commitment to lead a drug-free lifestyle. 
 
 This is an encouraging start. I hope this will encourage our youths to commit to staying drug-free and play an active role in sharing the anti-drug message.
 
Conclusion
 
 We must continue to do more and work together, to keep our youths away from drugs. All of us have a part to play in this effort – parents, educators, community partners, and our youths as well. Together, let us keep Singapore drug-free.
 
 Thank you.

ESCAPING IS HARD.
DON’T START.
 
Empowering Youths: Say No to Drugs as Escape from Addiction is Hard 
 
 Imagine this: 200 people in lockdown, with only a small number able to escape. 
 

 This was all part of the first-ever anti-drug themed “The Escape Game” launched by Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr Amrin Amin, at the annual Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign (ADAC) today. ADAC is jointly organised by the Central
    Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), to commemorate the World Drug Day[1].
 
 The Escape Game is made up of four zones - “The Contact”, “The Addiction”, “The Struggle” and “The Realisation” – which mimic the phases that a drug addict goes through in his/her attempt to escape
    addiction. The zones are designed to be challenging, illustrating the true reality of overcoming addiction. 
 
 In his speech[2], Parliamentary Secretary Amrin called on youths and families to support the anti-drug cause. He later elaborated, “Over 2000 participants have signed up for the event. We hope that this experience of a
    challenging anti-drug themed escape game will invoke thought about the difficulty of escaping from drugs once hooked. We are also happy that this is the 6th year that Singapore Polytechnic students have assisted us to organise this large-scale
    national-level campaign. Their peer-targeted focus gives us fresh perspective to the drug issue. Youths and families can use this experience to kickstart the conversation within their homes, school community and workplace and spread the anti-drug
    message to their friends and families.” 
 
 There are a slew of activities organised to commemorate the World Drug Day. Danceworks![3], an anti-drug dance competition is one of the key highlights. Into its 18th year, Danceworks! will see 21 teams battle it
    out for the title championship and the newly-introduced “Most Supported” team category. 
 
Empowering Stakeholders: Launch of Information Brochure for Parents and NS Commanders 

 As part of the recommendations of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs (TFYD), Parliamentary Secretary Amrin also launched two new anti-drug resources for parents and NS Commanders. Both groups had been earlier identified by the Task Force as key influencers
    to steer youths and young adults away from drugs. 
 
 Deputy Director of CNB, Mr Winston Wong, said “The drug issue is multi-faceted and requires the collaboration of the community to address the problem. We are grateful for the support from the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Singapore Civil Defence
    Force (SCDF) and the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) in their outreach to national servicemen. The anti-drug brochure for parents, available online, includes practical tips and advice for parents to guide their children against peer influence and stress.
    These new resources, which are only possible with the strong support of our TFYD partners, provide a good opportunity to remind our young adults about the importance of staying drug-free.”
 
 Make a stand. Support the anti-drug movement and spread the message to your friends and families. Please refer to the attached factsheet for more information. You can also download the toolkits at the CNB website[4].

223,Two CNB operations on 23 June 2016 netted large seizure of drugs; drug syndicate busted,2016-06-24,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/two-cnb-operations-on-23-june-2016-netted-large-seizure-of-drugs-drug-syndicate-busted," On 23 June 2016, the Central Narcotics Bureau launched two separate operations that saw large seizures of a variety of drugs and the dismantling of one drug trafficking syndicate. The entire haul of drugs seized from these two operations was estimated
to be worth more than S$236,000.
Drug bust at Jalan Bukit Merah

 In the afternoon hours of 23 June 2016, a party of CNB officers was deployed in the vicinity of Jalan Bukit Merah to apprehend a suspected drug trafficker. At about 3.25pm, the suspected drug trafficker, a 48-year-old male Singaporean, was spotted driving
    into a carpark in the vicinity. CNB officers moved in to arrest the 48-year-old shortly after he had alighted from his vehicle. Officers recovered a total of about 500g of heroin from the 48-year-old. Cash totaling more than S$13,000 was also recovered
    from him.
 
 CNB officers proceeded to raid the suspected drug trafficker’s unit in the vicinity. From within the unit, a small amount of heroin was recovered, along with a digital weighing scale and numerous empty plastic sachets. A suspected drug abuser
    – a 62-year-old male Singaporean – was also arrested within the unit.
 
 From swift follow-up investigations, CNB officers arrested the suspected drug courier – a 22-year-old male Malaysian. A search of the motorcycle belonging to the 22-year-old suspected drug courier was conducted and officers recovered a total of
    S$14,500 in cash that was placed in the compartment under the seat.
 
Syndicate busted, syndicate leader and associate arrested
 
 In another separate operation conducted on 23 June 2016, CNB officers raided the hideout of a suspected drug syndicate leader (a 56-year-old male Singaporean) at Lorong 39 Geylang, and recovered about 1.8kg of heroin, 130g of ‘Ice’ and 40
    Erimin-5 tablets within the room occupied by the suspect.
 
 A few hours later, CNB officers deployed at Bedok North Road arrested the suspected associate of the suspected syndicate leader, at a carpark in the vicinity. The suspected associate, a 46-year-old male Singaporean, was escorted to his residence in
    the same area, and officers recovered about 1kg of cannabis, 240g of heroin and 35g of ‘Ice’ from within the unit. Cash of S$4,400 and US$100 was also recovered. A search of the 46-year-old’s car recovered a bottle of methadone.
 
 Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which
    is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week. Those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis[2] may also face the death penalty.

Shortly thereafter, the four of them parted ways.  Officers swiftly moved in to arrest the four suspected drug offenders, and approximately 1.4kg of heroin, worth more than S$99,000, was recovered from a haversack the 46-year-old was carrying. CNB
also seized over S$30,000 during this operation.  Investigations are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient
to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.  CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

The lorry was carrying a consignment of pails and cans as well
as a consignment of shield anchors.
In the course of inspection by the ICA officers, drugs totalling about 2,780g of heroin and 480g of ‘Ice’ were found.  The drugs were concealed in the compartment behind the passenger seat of the lorry.  The lorry driver and the
passenger, male Malaysians aged 33 and 27 respectively, were arrested and referred to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).  Investigations are ongoing.  The estimated worth of this haul of drugs is more than S$282,000.  
The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of
about 180 abusers for a week.  The MDA also provides for the death penalty if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g.  250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week[1].

Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security, and security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  The Home Team agencies will continue to conduct checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints
to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

230,About 5kg of cannabis and half kg of heroin seized in CNB operation on 6 May 2016,2016-05-06,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/about-5kg-of-cannabis-and-half-kg-of-heroin-seized-in-cnb-operation-on-6-may-2016,"  On 6 May 2016, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) launched an operation to apprehend a suspected drug courier and a suspected drug trafficker, seizing about 5kg of cannabis and 450g of heroin. The entire haul of drugs from this operation is estimated
to be worth more than S$196,000. 
 

 In the morning of 6 May 2016, CNB officers were deployed at the vicinity of Pasir Ris Grove to look out for a suspected drug trafficker. At about 7.30am, officers spotted a trailer driven by a suspected drug courier, a 40-year-old male Malaysian. At
    about 8.00am, CNB officers spotted the suspected trafficker, a 35-year-old male Singaporean, with a female companion arriving at the vicinity in a car. 
 
 The 35-year-old suspected trafficker was seen boarding the trailer cabin from the passenger side. A short while later, the suspected trafficker came out of the trailer cabin and proceeded back to his car. He was seen carrying a paper bag. 
 
 The suspected drug trafficker then drove off and was tailed by a party of CNB officers. The car was eventually parked at a carpark along Jalan Kayu and CNB officers swiftly moved in to place the male suspect and his female companion [a 33-year-old Singaporean]
    under arrest. Officers searched the car and recovered about 3kg of cannabis and 450g of heroin from within it. 
 
 Another party of officers who kept observation on the trailer saw the suspected courier coming down from the cabin and placed him under arrest. A search of the trailer cabin recovered about 2kg of cannabis and cash of S$7,500. 
 
 Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis[1] may face the death penalty. The Misuse of
    Drugs Act also provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws[2], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180
    abusers for a week.

231,MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT,2016-04-29,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/misuse-of-drugs-acts," MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT
 
 With effect from 1 May 2016, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all 20 New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] and one tryptamine generic group currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), in
the First Schedule of the same Act. This means that these substances will bereclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). Two new psychoactive substances commonly known as MT-45 and 4,4’-DMAR will also be listed in
the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B).
 

 Following the listing of the 20 NPS and one tryptamine generic group as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty
    of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered
    to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.
 
 Four new substances will also be listed in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (seeAnnex C). This enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.
 
Global NPS Situation
 
 There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in February 2016 by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, there were at least 643 NPS identified in 2015, a significant increase
    from the 2009 figure of 126[2].
 
 Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has also been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. The listing of new
    NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA is a necessary pre-emptive move to restrict the circulation of these harmful substances in our community.

MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS
OPENING ADDRESS FOR CNB WORKPLAN SEMINAR 2016
AT Health Promotion Board (HPB) Auditorium
25 APRIL 2016 
 
 
Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, CNB
CNB Officers
Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
Introduction

  I am pleased to join you this morning at the CNB Workplan Seminar 2016.
 

CNB continues to do well in keeping Singapore safe from drugs. The number of drug abusers arrested last year was about 3,300. This is less than 0.1% of the resident population in Singapore. 
 
However, the global drug situation remains challenging, and this in turn affects Singapore. We have observed certain local trends that are of concern, such as the online distribution of drugs, the threat of new psychoactive substances or NPS, and the
    increasingly casual attitudes of our youths regarding drug abuse. Hence, it is important for CNB to continue its efforts in 3 areas – engage, educate and enforce – to attain its vision of a Singapore without drugs.  
 
Engage
 
First, engage. CNB must continue to engage our local and regional partners and beyond that, at the international level to make Singapore’s voice heard at international platforms. This is crucial as many countries are shifting their positions and
    approaches in handling the drug problem. 
 
For example,
    
Some countries are considering decriminalising drug use, or legalising cannabis. 
 
Some have advocated for the adoption of harm reduction approaches, such as needle exchange or opiate substitution. 
 
Others have framed the drug problem as purely a public health or medical issue. 


 
Last week, Minister Shanmugam delivered a statement at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem, or UNGASS. This is an important platform for the international community to discuss the future of global drug policy.
    I will highlight the key points he made:
    
First, drugs are a serious threat to societies and to Governments who want to build a better life for their people.
 
Second, the drug abuse situation in Singapore is under control. We have adopted a comprehensive and sustained approach to tackling both drug supply and demand.
 
Third, Minister explained that decriminalisation, legalisation and the harm reduction approach does not work in Singapore as: 

 

 Our focus is on building a drug-free Singapore, not a drug-tolerant one. 
 
Harm reduction programmes do not fundamentally recognise that drug abuse impairs the individual’s cognitive ability. In addition, we have little to no HIV infections from injecting drug users. 
 
Instead, Singapore adopts a demand reduction approach. This is the best way to keep our families and children safe from drugs.  


 
ASEAN member states also delivered a joint statement at UNGASS, to   reaffirm our collective commitment to a comprehensive approach in both demand and supply reduction efforts in realising the regional vision of a Drug-Free ASEAN.
 
UNGASS 2016 culminated in the adoption of an outcome document where member states remain committed to the goals and objectives set out in the international drug control conventions. This is a good outcome as the conventions stand firm against calls for
    decriminalisation and legalisation of drugs. I would like to commend CNB for their hard work, working in close collaboration with MHQ and MFA, in the negotiation of the outcome document. 
 
Singapore, together with our ASEAN counterparts, must continue to put forward our views and actively shape the new global drug strategy in 2019. Singapore will host the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters later this year, in October.
    This will be a key platform to rally ASEAN member states for a common position towards 2019.
 

Educate
 
 Second, educate. Preventive Drug Education (PDE) remains our first line of defence. Our work to educate youths to say ‘no’ to drugs is made more urgent with the increase in new, young drug abusers arrested in Singapore. Our survey and research
    studies have also shown a significant proportion of older youths thinking that “it is ok to try drugs”. 
 
 CNB has been working with post-secondary institutions, MOE and MINDEF to strengthen our PDE efforts and outreach. CNB has also developed PDE toolkits and information brochures to support parents and educators in guiding youths to stay away from drugs.
    The information brochures for parents will be launched in June, and distributed to parents of all secondary and post-secondary students.
 
 Apart from parents and educators, we must also enable the community and other agencies to play a bigger part in PDE. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) is one such partner. I am pleased to launch the revamped Addiction Alley at the HPB Healthzone today
    [new initiative]. CNB has worked with HPB to revamp the Addiction Alley by refreshing and updating the exhibits. Through the interactive exhibits, we hope youths can learn about the addictiveness and harmful effects of drugs. We
    must also encourage parents and educators to visit this exhibition, as it showcases many interesting facts that they can use to initiate conversations with youths.
 
 To deal with the youth drug problem, the Ministry has set up a Committee Against Youth Drug Abuse, which I chair. This is an inter-agency committee, which comprises young people and representatives from MHA, CNB, HPB, Institute of Mental Health and post-secondary
    institutions. The Committee will explore new methods to engage youths, such as through online platforms, youth-led participatory action, or enlisting anti-drug ambassadors that youths can relate to. We will also conduct research studies and literature
    reviews to inform us on how best to tackle youth drug issues.  
 
Enforce
 
 Third, enforce. We must continue with our enforcement efforts to tackle both drug supply and demand. For instance, to tackle youth drug abuse, CNB has committed more resources in investigating youth abuse cases. Suspected youth drug abusers are quickly
    brought in for investigation so that CNB can:
    
First, assess their risks and needs to provide the most appropriate interventions;
 
Second, prevent them from influencing their peers to abuse drugs; and
 
Third, follow up on leads involving drug suppliers of these youths so that CNB can take them out swiftly. 


 
 We have also enhanced our laws to give CNB more levers to deal with the emerging threat of NPS. In May 2013, the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act was enacted to allow CNB to control the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in
    the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. This allows CNB to seize these substances so that circulation is restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. Subsequently, if there
    are no licit industrial or medical uses, the NPS will be re-classified as Class A controlled drugs. Given the speed at which new variations of NPS are emerging, we need to closely monitor global developments, review our laws and enhance our detection
    capabilities for NPS.
 
 To deal more decisively against drug trafficking syndicates, many of which operate across national borders, CNB will soon have additional powers under a new law. The Organised Crime Act (OCA) was passed in Parliament last year and will soon come into
    force. The OCA will give CNB more powers such as Organised Crime Prevention Orders, Financial Reporting Orders and Civil Confiscation Orders to disrupt and dismantle transnational drug trafficking syndicates. 
 
Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, I want to acknowledge the hard work of our CNB officers. The work that you do has made Singapore a safer home, towards our goal of a drug-free nation. I urge you to continue to uphold your values of professionalism, integrity, dedication
    and courage in all that you do. 
 
 I wish all of you a fruitful workplan seminar. Thank you.

 
SPEECH BY MR NG SER SONG, DIRECTOR CNB, FOR CNB WORKPLAN SEMINAR 2016, AT HEALTH PROMOTION BOARD, 25 APRIL 2016 (MONDAY)
 
Mr Amrin Amin
Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs
Distinguished guests, Home Team colleagues and fellow officers
A very good morning and welcome to CNB’s Workplan Seminar 2016. I thank you all for gracing this event.

 
CNB’s Key Achievements in 2015
  2015 has been an eventful year for CNB. We had successfully hosted the 36th Meeting of ASEAN Senior Officials on Drug Matters (or ASOD). CNB was also involved in the first-ever Asia-Pacific Forum against Drugs (or APFAD) organised by
National Council Against Drug Abuse or NCADA. Both were major regional events which brought together local and foreign policy and enforcement agencies as well as NGOs dealing with drug matters. These events provided the opportunity for Singapore to showcase
the success of our holistic anti-drug strategies and rally our regional partners to stand united for a drug-free aspiration. 
 

 At the national level, many of us were called to be part of the Home Team security effort to maintain law and order during the lying in state of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the 2015 General Elections. The responsibilities were heavy. I am proud that our officers
    went beyond the call of duty to support the Home Team in these major events. 
 
 I am heartened to see that even with all these additional responsibilities, our officers persevered with intensive enforcement efforts. These included the routine and major anti-drug operations, as well as joint operations with Police and ICA. 
 
 I would like to thank our officers for working tirelessly and our partners for your support in helping to keep Singapore drug-free. 

CNB’s Operating Environment and Challenges
 
 Today, our drug situation is largely under control even as our operating environment continues to be challenging and ever-changing. 
 
 First, local demand and supply of drugs is influenced largely by global and regional developments. Drug seizures and production in the region have increased. International drug syndicates have also formed networks within Southeast Asia to manufacture,
    receive and distribute drugs to the region. 
 
 Second, while traditional drugs like heroin, ‘Ice’ and cannabis remain the main drugs trafficked and abused, the emergence of non-conventional drugs like New Psychoactive Substances or NPS are gaining popularity. 
 
 The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (or UNODC) recently reported that more countries are detecting NPS in their drug seizures. Globally, more than 640 NPS have been reported to the UNODC monitoring database.  This is a very significant
    increase, from only 126 NPS reported in 2009. 
 
 Despite the prevalence of these substances, little is known of their toxicity and long-term adverse effects. Traffickers also continue to promote them as safe substitutes to known illicit drugs.  
 
 Third, the online market place provides convenience and privacy to users. It also facilitates a new mode of drug trafficking which will make detections and investigations difficult. 
 
 Fourth, we observe a change in the demographics of youth abusers. They are better educated and some come from middle or upper income families. Our current strategies may not be the most suitable to tackle this emerging trend. This evolving drug abuse
    landscape presents new challenges for us and we need to rethink the way we do preventive drug education, enforcement, rehabilitation and supervision. 
 
 Lastly, the Home Team is also facing manpower constraints amidst increasing workload and higher public expectations. This is a challenge that is not confined to CNB. We must think out-of-the-box and improve the way we operate to optimise resources.
 
The Fight against Drugs at the Global Stage
 
 Beyond domestic and regional challenges, we also need to pay attention to international developments on drug control policies. In recent years, there has been an increasing shift towards liberal policies such as decriminalisation of drugs and legalisation
    of cannabis, and advocacy for harm reduction approaches in treatment. These developments have the potential to impact our domestic policies, and erode the support for our zero-tolerance approach to drugs.
 
 I attended the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs or CND in March and have just returned yesterday from another international meeting on drug matters - the UN General Assembly Special Session on World Drug Problem or UNGASS. 
 
 It was apparent from discussions at such international platforms that many countries no longer strive for a drug free society.  They have instead, turned to address secondary effects of drug use such as reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other
    infectious diseases rather than addressing the main issue which is to  eliminate drug addiction altogether.  
 
 Our key message at the CND and UNGASS is clear: We understand that each country has its own unique set of circumstances and hence has the right to implement drug control policies which best addresses its needs. Likewise, Singapore and ASEAN have the
    right to chart our own course and implement policies that are reflective of our circumstances and aspirations. For us, we don’t want to focus on curing the symptom. We want our people to be free from drug addiction.  
 
 As Parliamentary Secretary has highlighted, we secured Singapore’s key positions in the UNGASS Outcome Document. We had also worked closely with our ASEAN counterparts on a joint statement to reaffirm our commitment to a drug-free region at the
    UN level.  
 
 Come this October, Singapore will be organising the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters (or AMMD). At the strategic level, the meeting will continue the momentum from UNGASS to sustain our response for a drug-free aspiration. It
    will also adopt a new ASEAN work plan for the next ten years. We need to be engaged in the international and regional movements so that we are coordinated with our partners, not only to protect our common interest, but also simply because the drug syndicates
    operate across borders.  
 
 At the tactical level, CNB has maintained close ties with our neighbours such as Malaysia’s Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (or NCID). For example, we had worked with NCID to uncover the plans of an international drug syndicate. Through
    our cooperation, the Malaysian Police seized RM 1.3 million worth of ketamine in their largest ketamine bust yet in 2016. This is just one of the many examples of how we work closely with foreign counterparts to contain the drug problem. 
 
 In short, it is important for us to proactively participate at various regional and international platforms to shape drug control policies and maintain our international space. 
 
Embracing Change
 
 Next I would like to focus on the theme of this year’s WPS: ‘Transforming Towards A Future-Ready CNB’. We live in a fast-changing world and thus we need to transform to keep pace and to stay ahead. 
 
 CNB has traditionally adopted an enforcement-focused approach to tackle the drug problem. This has helped to keep the drug situation in check. It has enabled us to provide a safe and secure home for families to bring up their children in. However, we
    cannot be complacent and believe that the same strategies will provide us with the same success over the next few decades. 
 
 We will need to adapt if we are to face ever-evolving challenges. What happens if we fail to transform? 
 
 Let me highlight the case of Nokia. Many of us would have owned a Nokia phone at some point in time. Nokia was at the top of the market in the 1990s and early 2000s. But within a decade, how many of us owns one or would actually still want to own a Nokia
    phone? 
 
 How did this happen? Nokia CEO gave us the answer. At a press conference to announce the company being acquired by Microsoft, he said - “We didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow we lost.” Nokia continued to pursue the same strategies
    that had brought them success. Even though the market had changed due to advances in technology, Nokia did not transform. When the mobile phone market became the smartphone market, Nokia became redundant and obsolete.
 
 The same lesson holds true for CNB. We will not be able to win tomorrow’s war with yesterday’s strategies. Today we have a relatively stable drug situation. This did not come by chance, but through the hard work of the generations of CNB
    officers who came before us. They have also adapted to the changing landscape over the past 45 years of CNB’s history. 
 
CNB’s Transformation Journey
 
 We started on the change process with a re-visioning exercise in 2014. We refreshed our Vision and Mission statements to reinforce the commitment that each and every officer has to building a drug-free Singapore.
 
 Since then, together with the rest of the Home Team, CNB has developed a set of transformation plans to address the challenges and constraints.
     
 

 Our strategies will be aligned to our three operational strategies of (i) Preventive Drug Education & Engagement, (ii) Enforcement and (iii) Supervision to ensure a holistic approach in dealing with the complex drug problem. Our transformation efforts
    in these key areas will be supported by robust policy and research, long term planning in technology adoption, as well as effective resource and manpower plans. 
 
 I will just highlight two examples in the areas of preventive drug education and the supervision of ex-drug abusers:
     

Preventive Drug Education


 
 Preventive Drug Education (PDE) is the first line of defence in CNB’s overall drug control approach. As the saying goes – “Prevention is better than cure”. If done effectively, this would reduce the downstream impact on CNB. What
    could this mean in actual impact to us? A reduction in the abuser population and fewer supervisees for us. This will in turn free up more resources to focus on reducing supply.
 
 We have adopted a targeted and differentiated approach through specific outreach platforms for our PDE offerings. We also have in the pipeline, collaboration plans with the NCADA to empower youths and key influencers to be strong proponents of Singapore’s
    anti-drug approach.
     

Next Generation Reporting Centre 


 
 Another project, the Next Generation Reporting Centre. There is an expected increase in the number of drug supervisees. We recognise the need to seek the best approach to optimise resources and processes. We have to find a way to improve the current
    situation to reduce reliance on manpower and better redeploy our resources. 
 
 We are exploring the use of self-service technology and automation in the management of drug supervisees. 
 
Conclusion
 
 The times ahead will be challenging but also exciting. Yet this also presents us with a chance to chart the future direction that CNB will take.
 
 To my fellow CNB officers, you will be part of the future. I urge you to take an active role in the transformation process. Seize the chance to make an impact. This process can only take place if all of us actively support, participate and champion this
    idea. Let us move forward together on this journey to future-proof CNB and fulfil our aspiration for a Drug-Free Singapore. 
 
 I look forward to a fruitful discussion with the officers later on. To our guests, thank you once again for attending CNB WPS 2016.

235,United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem,2016-04-21,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/united-nations-general-assembly-special-session-on-the-world-drug-problem," 
UNGASS Roundtable 2– Supply Reduction & related measures; responses to drug-related crime; and countering money-laundering and promoting judicial cooperation (“drugs and crime”) 
 
20th April 2016
 Singapore believes that supply reduction is an integral component in tackling the world drug problem. It forms one of the three pillars of international drug control policy and needs to
be applied in an integrated and balanced manner, together with demand reduction and international cooperation strategies. In this regard, there are three key issues Singapore would like to share:
Prominent Role of Law Enforcement

 For Singapore, the role of law enforcement will always be an integral part in our fight against the scourge of drugs. We embrace a zero tolerance approach towards drugs, hence our strategy against
    drug trafficking is to detect and arrest all traffickers before they band together into large-scale and sophisticated players in the drug scene. We conduct rigorous drug enforcement, coupled with strong command, control and communication elements to
    increase operational effectiveness and minimise operational risks. 
 
 As a key transportation and financial hub with close proximity to the Golden Triangle, Singapore faces the danger of being exploited as a transit centre for traffickers. However, we have managed
    to keep the drug supply situation under control, largely attributing this success to our tough and vigorous enforcement in reducing the supply of drugs into our borders. 
 
New Challenges 
 
 Criminal syndicates will continue to find new ways and means to circumvent the criminal justice system. The links between drug trafficking to corruption and other forms of organized crime such as
    money laundering continue to pose serious challenges to our supply reduction efforts. Singapore has consistently reviewed our processes to ensure that we are doing whatever we can to counter these illicit activities. For example, to counter the lure
    of high profits from drug trafficking, we employ the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes Act to trace, freeze and confiscate assets of convicted drug traffickers. An Organised Crime Act was enacted in 2015 to further strengthen our
    efforts in disrupting and mitigating the impact of trans-national drug trafficking syndicates. 
 
 We read with concern from the World Drug Report of another year of increase in the detection of clandestine laboratories, making it imperative that we also stop the diversion of and trafficking in
    precursors chemicals, and now pre-precursors, which are used in the manufacture of ATS and New Psychoactive Substances (NPS). NPS have proliferated rapidly in the last few years and have posed as a serious challenge due to the difficulty in scheduling
    them. We need to enhance the capability of our law enforcement agencies to detect and identify these substances whilst working together to share information and promote cross-border cooperation. 
 
 We recognise that we are often one step behind in scheduling NPS due to the rapid pace that they are being created. Singapore has listed a number of NPS as controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs
    Act (MDA) for short, both under the generic families of NPS and individual NPS listing. MDA also allows the temporary listing of NPS for 12 months under the Fifth Schedule, with the possibility of extension by another 12 months. This would allow us
    to seize these NPS whilst research and industry consultations take place before a decision is made on the permanent listing of NPS. After the 12 months, the NPS that are temporarily listed would be considered for re-classification as controlled drugs
    under the MDA.
 
 NPS and the challenges mentioned are global challenges. We are in this together. Hence we need to step up our regional and international cooperation, especially with regards to information sharing.
    My delegation is pleased to see substantive recommendations on increasing cross border cooperation in the outcome document and we will continue to play our part in the regional and international arena. I would also like to commend and thank the
    UNODC for their initiatives such as the Global SMART and Container Control programme which have been integral in the fight against illicit trafficking. 
 
 In conclusion, we strongly support the three international drug conventions as the cornerstone for all drug control policies as they provide the flexibility for states to address their specific needs,
    whilst complying with the principle of common and shared responsibility. We would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to meeting the targets set in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action, in addition to the operational
    recommendations contained in the outcome document. 

 

UNGASS Roundtable 4 – Cross-cutting issues: new challenges, threats and realities in preventing and addressing the world drug problem in compliance with relevant international law, including the three drug control conventions; strengthening
the principle of common and shared responsibility and international cooperation
 
21st April 2016
 
 The drug situation is constantly evolving. Criminal syndicates will persistently look for ways to evade laws in their endeavours to traffic illicit drugs. In recent years, we have all
faced the challenge of rapid proliferation of new psychoactive substances and the increasing sales of illicit drugs online. 
New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)
 

 Many of the NPS are still not controlled under the international drug control conventions, and their legal statuses differ widely from country to country. Little is known about the adverse health
    effects and long term harms of NPS, and this pose considerable challenges for prevention and treatment. 
 
 In Singapore, we realized that the traditional way of listing harmful substances was unable to address the rapid proliferation of a large number of NPS varieties. A more responsive approach was needed,
    and in 2013, amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act were made. A new Fifth Schedule was introduced to provide for temporary listing of NPS. 
 
 The Fifth Schedule was enacted to allow us to list NPS quickly for a period of one year. It provided us with a mechanism to take action against substances which have just appeared in our drug scene
    but which we have little information about. Once listed, we are empowered to seize the substances to prevent their circulation. During the period the substances are temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule, research and industrial consultations are
    undertaken to determine the possible legitimate uses for these NPS as part of the due process before the decision is taken to permanently list them as controlled drugs.  
 
 Besides the Fifth Schedule, we have also adopted the generic listing system to deal with the large numbers of closely related NPS. After a year, all temporarily listed NPS will be classified as Class
    A controlled drugs if no legitimate use was found. This approach has helped us to efficiently control the NPS before its abuse spreads in society. 
 
 Currently, we have listed 10 generic groups of substances and 54 individual substances through this process. We consistently keep abreast of the NPS abuse situation and update the fifth schedule
    regularly. 
 
 My delegation would like to take this opportunity to thank the UNODC specifically the Global SMART programme whose Early Warning System has played an integral role in highlighting the emergence of
    the various NPS and in providing a platform for countries to share data and information. 
 
 Singapore will continue to closely monitor international development and improve our NPS detection capabilities and strengthen our NPS framework.
 

Misuse of the Internet 
 
 Technological advancements on the Internet have enabled the local drug trade to take on a transnational form. In Singapore, we have seen cases of internet-ordered NPS being transported in mail parcels.
    Due to the furtive nature of such online black markets, it poses a challenge for law enforcement to operationally track individuals who are leveraging on this platform to buy or sell drugs in this manner.
 
 Taking into account the large volume of parcels coming through our borders each day, the lack of information on the packaging or originating source country of these drugs would make them more difficult to track.
    The wider implication of such online black markets is that there could possibly be a subset of abusers who are buying drugs in this manner, and go undetected; hence making the rise of these drugs more difficult to track. 
 
 Singapore adopts a balanced approach to tackle the challenges of Internet-based drug activities and the associate problem of drugs entering Singapore via this method. We have continuously aimed to develop upstream
    intelligence whilst simultaneously pursuing downstream enforcement. We build partnerships and capabilities of regulatory authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority and the postal and courier services. 
 
 My delegation is pleased that the outcome document addresses these concerns, especially with the recommendations on enhancing information sharing amongst member states and developing capabilities to preserve
    and investigate electronic evidence related to illicit drug trafficking. 
 
International Cooperation
 
 It is our obligation to our citizens to rise and meet these challenges in the most effective manner, which includes cooperation at regional and international levels. Collectively, we can better monitor developments,
    share information and best practices with one another. Singapore looks forward to working with the UNODC and member states in this regard. 
 
 In countering the drug scourge, we will continuously be faced with new threats and challenges. However, we believe strongly that any new threats and challenges can be addressed within the parameters of the international
    conventions. We would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to meeting the targets set in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action, in addition to the operational recommendations contained in the outcome document. Thank you.

Cash of more than S$16,000 was also
seized. The estimated worth of this haul of drugs is more than S$83,000. 
In the evening of 18 April 2016, CNB officers deployed in the vicinity of Rivervale Crescent spotted the suspected drug trafficker, a 30-year-old male Singaporean, and his female companion meeting up with two other associates – a male Singaporean
aged 24 and a female Singaporean aged 25. A short while later, the 30-year-old male, together with his two associates, left the vicinity in a car. The female companion, a 31-year-old Singaporean, left in a taxi and was arrested a short while
later. 
The three suspects were tailed to the vicinity of Mountbatten where they were arrested. A search of the car recovered a total of about 450g of ‘Ice’, 15g of heroin, 50g of cannabis, three ‘Ecstasy’ tablets and an Erimin-5
tablet. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g. 250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction
of about 185 abusers for a week[1].

worth over S$177,000. 
4-day Island-wide operation 
CNB launched a 4-day island-wide operation from 11 April 2016 to 15 April 2016, in which over 590g of heroin, 329g of ‘Ice’, 80g of cannabis, 153 ecstasy tablets, 26 Erimin-5 tablets and some ketamine worth over S$107,000 were seized. 103
suspected drug offenders were also arrested for various drug offences. The operation was supported by officers from the Singapore Police Force, and spanned different parts of Singapore such as Tampines, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Clementi, Punggol, Sembawang,
Woodlands and Yishun.
Operation involving seizure of over 570g of heroin
In one of the cases in the island-wide operation, officers seized over 570g of heroin worth over S$40,000 and over S$2000 in cash. In this operation, officers had arrested a suspected drug abuser, a 52-year-old Singaporean male at the vicinity of Upper
Boon Keng Road, seizing some Erimin-5 tablets and drug paraphernalia. At the same time, officers noticed a man behaving suspiciously in the vicinity. Over 80g of heroin, 7 Erimin-5 tablets and some cash were seized from the man, a 60-year-old Singaporean.
Follow up investigations led to the arrest of a suspected drug trafficker, who was suspected of supplying drugs to the 60-year-old man. Officers were deployed in the vicinity of Somerset, and the suspected drug trafficker, a 28-year-old Malaysian male,
was arrested. 450g of heroin was recovered from him.
Operation involving seizure of over 1kg of heroin 
In a separate operation on 11 April 2016, CNB officers arrested a suspected drug trafficker and his associate, seizing over 1kg of heroin and a small amount of ‘Ice’. This had an estimated street worth of over S$73,700. 
On the night of 11 April 2016, officers were deployed at the vicinity of Holland Close and Woodlands Drive 52 to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker, a 37-year-old Singaporean male, and his suspected drug associate, a 47-year-old Singaporean
male. The 37-year-old suspected drug trafficker was swiftly arrested when he returned to his hideout at Woodlands Drive 52. About 1 kg of heroin and a small amount of ‘Ice’ were recovered from him. A small amount of heroin was also recovered
from the 37-year-old’s hideout. 
The 47-year-old suspected drug associate was arrested in the early morning of 12 April 2016 at the vicinity of Holland Close. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act allows for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. CNB will continue to keep up the pressure on the ground, through
regular island-wide operations and targeted operations to get drug traffickers and abusers alike off the streets of Singapore.

 In various operations carried out over the course of the week (11 – 15 April 2016), the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) seized over 1.5kg of heroin, 329g of ‘Ice’, 80g of cannabis, 153 ecstasy tablets, 26 Erimin-5 tablets and some ketamine
worth over S$177,000.  4-day Island-wide operation  CNB launched a 4-day island-wide operation from 11 April 2016 to 15 April 2016, in which over 590g of heroin, 329g of ‘Ice’, 80g of cannabis, 153 ecstasy tablets, 26 Erimin-5 tablets and some ketamine worth over S$107,000 were seized. 103
suspected drug offenders were also arrested for various drug offences. The operation was supported by officers from the Singapore Police Force, and spanned different parts of Singapore such as Tampines, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Clementi, Punggol, Sembawang,
Woodlands and Yishun. Operation involving seizure of over 570g of heroin In one of the cases in the island-wide operation, officers seized over 570g of heroin worth over S$40,000 and over S$2000 in cash. In this operation, officers had arrested a suspected drug abuser, a 52-year-old Singaporean male at the vicinity of Upper
Boon Keng Road, seizing some Erimin-5 tablets and drug paraphernalia. At the same time, officers noticed a man behaving suspiciously in the vicinity. Over 80g of heroin, 7 Erimin-5 tablets and some cash were seized from the man, a 60-year-old Singaporean. Follow up investigations led to the arrest of a suspected drug trafficker, who was suspected of supplying drugs to the 60-year-old man. Officers were deployed in the vicinity of Somerset, and the suspected drug trafficker, a 28-year-old Malaysian male,
was arrested. 450g of heroin was recovered from him. Operation involving seizure of over 1kg of heroin  In a separate operation on 11 April 2016, CNB officers arrested a suspected drug trafficker and his associate, seizing over 1kg of heroin and a small amount of ‘Ice’. This had an estimated street worth of over S$73,700.  On the night of 11 April 2016, officers were deployed at the vicinity of Holland Close and Woodlands Drive 52 to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker, a 37-year-old Singaporean male, and his suspected drug associate, a 47-year-old Singaporean
male. The 37-year-old suspected drug trafficker was swiftly arrested when he returned to his hideout at Woodlands Drive 52. About 1 kg of heroin and a small amount of ‘Ice’ were recovered from him. A small amount of heroin was also recovered
from the 37-year-old’s hideout.  The 47-year-old suspected drug associate was arrested in the early morning of 12 April 2016 at the vicinity of Holland Close.  Investigations into the drug activities of all suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act allows for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. CNB will continue to keep up the pressure on the ground, through
regular island-wide operations and targeted operations to get drug traffickers and abusers alike off the streets of Singapore.    CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

238,About 4kg of cannabis seized at Woodlands Checkpoint. Substantial amount of drugs seized in follow-up operation. Six Singaporeans arrested.,2016-04-15,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/about-4kg-of-cannabis-seized-at-woodlands-checkpoint.-substantial-amount-of-drugs-seized-in-follow-up-operation.-six-singaporeans-arrested,"  On 14 April 2016 at about 8am, a Singapore-registered car was stopped by officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) for checks upon arrival at Woodlands Checkpoint. 
 

 In the course of inspection, ICA officers found four blocks of cannabis weighing about 4kg and one bundle of ‘Ice’ weighing about 310g. The driver, a 25-year-old male Singaporean, and the seized exhibits were referred to the Central Narcotics
    Bureau (CNB) for further investigations. 
 
 From swift follow-up investigations, CNB officers arrested a total of three suspected traffickers – two male Singaporeans aged 25 and 26 and a 26-year-old female Singaporean – and two suspected abusers – two male Singaporeans aged 24
    and 32. A substantial variety of drugs were seized from the follow-up operation, including about 2.1kg of cannabis, 380g of ‘Ice’, 152 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 102 Erimin-5 tablets and 18g of heroin. 
 
 The estimated worth of the entire haul of drugs seized is more than S$418,000. 
 
 Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis; and those convicted of trafficking in more than 250g of methamphetamine, may face
    the death penalty. 1,000g of cannabis is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 143 abusers for a week. 250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week[1]. 
 
 Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security, and security checks are critical to our nation’s security. The Home Team agencies will continue to conduct checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent
    attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

The syndicate was suspected to be trafficking in different types of controlled drugs. About 740g of heroin[1] and
30g of ‘Ice’ were seized in total, with an estimated street worth of S$57,000.
On 31 March 2016, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker, a 39-year-old Singaporean female, who was believed to be receiving a fresh consignment of drugs. The 39-year-old was observed
to have met up with a 62-year-old Singaporean male at the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10. Both were subsequently arrested, and about 48g of heroin was recovered from the 39-year-old. About 160g of heroin was recovered from the 62-year-old. 
A search of the 39-year-old’s hideout at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 uncovered about 480g of heroin and 25g of ‘Ice’. Officers also raided the hideout of the 62-year-old, seizing about 40g of heroin. 
CNB’s investigations led officers to the hideout of a suspected drug associate of the 39-year-old, at a unit in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8. Upon CNB’s arrival at the unit at about 9pm on 31 March 2016, CNB officers identified themselves. The suspected
drug offender, a 48-year-old male Singaporean, refused to open the door and threatened to burn himself. He was also seen holding a chopper.
For safety reasons, the SPF and SCDF were activated. The residents from the neighbouring units were also evacuated. 
At about 10.00am on 1 April 2016, the 48-year-old suspected drug offender was arrested. A small amount of ‘Ice’ and heroin were recovered from the unit. Preliminary screening showed that the suspect tested positive for consumption of controlled
drugs. Another occupant was in the unit and she was unharmed.
Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested persons are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act allows for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 
Together with our partners in the Home Team, CNB will continue its unrelenting efforts to keep the streets of Singapore free of the drug scourge.

243,CNB maintains enforcement efforts in 2015 amid concerns from global and local drug situation.,2016-02-15,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/cnb-maintains-enforcement-efforts-in-2015-amid-concerns-from-global-and-local-drug-situation," The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested a total of 3,343 drug abusers in 2015, an increase of 6% from the 3,158 drug abusers arrested in 2014. The number of repeat abusers fell about 2%, from 2,065 abusers in 2014 to 2,034 abusers in 2015. 1,309 new drug abusers were arrested, which represented a 20% increase from the 1,093 arrested in 2014. Of these, more than two-thirds (69%) were below 30 years of age.  
Methamphetamine (or ‘Ice’) and heroin continue to be the two most commonly abused drugs. About 93% of all drug abusers arrested had abused one or the other. Notably, methamphetamine displaced heroin to become the most abused drug. For new abusers, methamphetamine (77%) and cannabis (12%) were the most commonly abused drugs, with cannabis displacing heroin as the second most commonly abused drug among new abusers.  
CNB carried out sustained and intensive enforcement efforts to prevent drugs from entering Singapore. In 2015, CNB conducted 49 major operations, of which 18 were island-wide operations involving the Singapore Police Force (SPF). These operations targeted middle-level traffickers, street-level pushers and drug abusers. Together with SPF and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), CNB also conducted 2,047 operations at the checkpoints to intercept drugs entering Singapore. These enforcement efforts crippled the operations of 21 drug syndicates. 
The estimated street value of the drugs seized in 2015 was S$8.56 million, which was 5% higher than in 2014. Cannabis seizures increased by about 26%, from 35.03 kg in 2014 to 44.29 kg in 2015.   
2015 was a milestone year for CNB’s preventive drug education efforts and outreach, as we commemorated the 20th anniversary of the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign. CNB will continue to review and update our preventive drug education and outreach efforts to spread the anti-drug message and garner strong support for our zero-tolerance approach towards drugs and drug abuse in Singapore.

The number of repeat abusers fell about 2%, from 2,065 abusers in 2014 to 2,034 abusers in 2015. 1,309 new drug abusers were arrested, which represented a 20% increase from the 1,093 arrested in 2014. Of these, more than two-thirds (69%) were below 30 years of age.   Methamphetamine (or ‘Ice’) and heroin continue to be the two most commonly abused drugs. About 93% of all drug abusers arrested had abused one or the other. Notably, methamphetamine displaced heroin to become the most abused drug. For new abusers, methamphetamine (77%) and cannabis (12%) were the most commonly abused drugs, with cannabis displacing heroin as the second most commonly abused drug among new abusers.   CNB carried out sustained and intensive enforcement efforts to prevent drugs from entering Singapore. In 2015, CNB conducted 49 major operations, of which 18 were island-wide operations involving the Singapore Police Force (SPF). These operations targeted middle-level traffickers, street-level pushers and drug abusers. Together with SPF and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), CNB also conducted 2,047 operations at the checkpoints to intercept drugs entering Singapore. These enforcement efforts crippled the operations of 21 drug syndicates.  The estimated street value of the drugs seized in 2015 was S$8.56 million, which was 5% higher than in 2014. Cannabis seizures increased by about 26%, from 35.03 kg in 2014 to 44.29 kg in 2015.    2015 was a milestone year for CNB’s preventive drug education efforts and outreach, as we commemorated the 20th anniversary of the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign. CNB will continue to review and update our preventive drug education and outreach efforts to spread the anti-drug message and garner strong support for our zero-tolerance approach towards drugs and drug abuse in Singapore.

             On 25 November 2017 at about 8.30am, officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) found suspected controlled drugs on an arriving Singapore-registered coach at Woodlands Checkpoint.  The suspected controlled drugs were found at the left-side panel and underneath the seats of the coach.  2          Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were alerted to the discovery and investigations were launched immediately to narrow down on the suspected drug importer.  With the proactive support of ICA as well as the camera footages from the coach, the suspect’s identity was narrowed down to that of a 29-year-old male Malaysian, who was subsequently stopped at the Woodlands Checkpoint when he attempted to depart Singapore. 3          The items recovered from the coach were about 31g of ‘Ice’, 25 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, ten black-coloured pills and six bottles of liquid substance, suspected to contain controlled drugs.  Investigations are ongoing.  Those convicted of unauthorised importation of any Class ‘A’ controlled drug will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.  4          Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security, and security checks are critical to our nation’s security.  The Home Team agencies will continue to conduct checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.   CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

On 7 November 2017 at about 10.20pm, an Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer directed an arriving Malaysia-registered car, driven by a lone 28-year-old Malaysian man, for further checks at Woodlands Checkpoint.


During the course of checks, officers from ICA and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), together with a narcotics detection dog from Singapore Police Force’s K9 Unit, uncovered a total of four bundles from within the car. The bundles were later
    found to contain a total of about 616g of ‘Ice’, 29g of ketamine, 590 Erimin-5 tablets and 20 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets. The haul of drugs was estimated to be worth more than S$69,000.


From follow-up investigations, the suspected intended recipients of the drugs, a 28-year-old man and a 32-year-old man, both Singaporeans, were arrested in the vicinity of Bedok North Street 1 in the pre-dawn hours of 8 November. CNB officers found
    about 10g of ‘Ice’, 4g of ketamine, 21 Erimin-5 tablets, 5 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets and other drug paraphernalia from the car driven by the 32-year-old man.

252,Heroin seized in CNB operation four arrested,2017-11-09,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/heroin-seized-in-cnb-operation-four-arrested," 
About 689g of heroin was seized in an operation conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) on 8 November 2017, which also saw the arrest of four suspected drug offenders, all Singaporeans. The drugs seized in this operation were estimated to be
    worth more than $72,000.


In the late hours of 8 November 2017, CNB officers were deployed in the vicinity of Jalan Besar to conduct observation on a group of suspected drug offenders. At about 10.50pm, the first suspect, a 46-year-old male, was spotted meeting up with a female
    along Mayo Street. They parted shortly after.


The 46-year-old male was arrested in the vicinity of a budget hotel at Jalan Besar and the 32-year-old female suspect was arrested at the junction of Sungei Road and Perak Road. The 46-year-old male was brought to his room at the hotel and CNB officers
    arrested two other suspects in the room, a 49-year-old male and a 54-year-old male.


Officers recovered about 482g of heroin inside the jeans worn by the 46-year-old male, as well as cash of S$6,474. Officers recovered a small amount of heroin on the 49-year-old male and officers recovered a further 200g of heroin and a small amount
    of ‘Ice’ from a bag belonging to the 54-year-old male. A small amount of heroin and ‘Ice’ was recovered from the table in the room.


Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws*,
    which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.

Introduction

A very good morning. I am very happy to be here today and a very warm welcome to Singapore. I am very pleased to join all of you this morning for the 4th Drug Advisory Programme Focal Point Meeting.
I would like to thank the Colombo Plan for giving us the opportunity to host this wonderful meeting. The Colombo Plan has been an integral partner, spearheading many initiatives in the areas of preventive drug education and rehabilitation. These initiatives
    have been impactful and lives have been and continue to be transformed for the better.
Children with substance abuse disorders can now be identified, assessed and treated more effectively because of the training provided to practitioners. Youths are equipped with life skills through initiatives organised by the Colombo Plan in drug prevention
    that helps them to navigate life’s challenges better. Anti-narcotics agencies have made good progress in advancing drug detection technologies and methodologies through closer partnerships and training. This has enabled them to effectively deal with
    the trading of illicit drugs and drug precursors.
Besides serving as an important platform for participants to share experiences and best practices, the Focal Point Meeting had provided opportunities to deepen partnerships and collaborations, sharing of strategies to reduce demand for drugs through
    the various workshops as well as bilateral relations fostered and strengthened through joint programmes. The facilitation of transfer of knowledge and skills across member states has been very helpful in fostering this good relationship.
Worsening Global and Regional Drug Situation
The worsening global drug situation is a stark reminder of the threat that we are facing, and why we need to step up our efforts, work together and stand united in the fight against drugs.
Based on the World Drug Report 2017, a quarter of a billion people had abused drugs at least once in 2015. Over 11% of those who had used drugs have suffered drug abuse disorders. Close to 200,000 drug-related deaths have been reported worldwide. 35% of these deaths had occurred in Asia. That means 70,000 deaths a year, or close to 200 deaths a day, in Asia.
Trends in the world and in the region are making it more difficult in our battle against illicit drug trafficking and use. Illicit drug producers and traffickers are not slowing down their criminal activities. Cannabis continues to be the most widely produced illicit drug worldwide. Global opium production increased by 30% to more than 6,000 tons. Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants doubled between 2010 and 2015. And in this same period, in East and South-East Asia, seizures of methamphetamine increased more than five-fold and heroin seizures increased by 75%.
Emerging Challenges
Even as we try to deal with the worsening drug landscape, there are new and emerging challenges that we have to grapple with.
New Psychoactive Substances
Seizures of new psychoactive substances, or NPS, have been significant. Enforcement against the abuse of NPS and regulating these drugs are particularly difficult. New substances are continually being developed and introduced into the market. It is not easy for drug enforcement agencies to keep up with the number of new substances. To add to the challenge, many NPS are being deceptively marketed as safe alternatives to illicit drugs, when in fact the harm they cause can be as great or even greater.
Online Drug Trade
Traffickers are leveraging the internet and online social platforms to facilitate their cross border drug trafficking activities. They hide behind the anonymity that the Internet provides to evade detection. This phenomenon is growing with more and more online black market sites sprouting up. Some of these sites are layered with sophisticated encryption software and advanced technology. They use electronic currency methods like Bitcoins for payment, and employ unsuspecting legitimate courier companies to deliver their wares.
To tackle the online drug trade, we need to strengthen and deepen transnational cooperation and intelligence sharing among enforcement agencies for greater effectiveness in targeting and disrupting their businesses.
Youth Drug Abuse
Another worrying trend is that traffickers are increasingly targeting youths online. We have seen how the youth drug abuse situation continues to be of concern here in Singapore. More than 40% of the drug abusers arrested in 2016 were below 30 years old. Close to two-thirds of new abusers arrested were also below 30 years old. Not only are the abusers getting younger, they are starting to adopt more tolerant attitudes towards drugs due to external influences.
A local study uncovered some worrying trends. First, there was rising acceptance of cannabis use. Second, young cannabis abusers had cited media celebrities, the Internet and peers as reasons for experimenting with drugs. Third, young abusers think that cannabis is less harmful and addictive than tobacco.
The socio-economic profiles of abusers are also changing. Many of these cannabis abusers came from well-to-do families. Many were high achievers in school. We have to keep a close watch on this and take decisive action to prevent the next generation of abusers from taking root.
Singapore’s Drug Control Approach
I had earlier encouraged you to share your strategies and programmes. So let me start the ball rolling.
Singapore adopts a harm prevention model towards drug abuse. Our harm prevention model has three limbs. First, upstream prevention. Second, rigorous enforcement supported by tough laws. Third, effective treatment and rehabilitation. This approach has worked well for us and kept our streets relatively drug-free.
Upstream Prevention
Singapore continues to believe in effective drug prevention programmes. It remains our first line of defence. We educate the young on the harms of drugs, we prevent them from falling prey to the online drug trade. We reach out to key influencers too - people such as teachers and parents, who can help the youths stay away from drugs.
We empower them with knowledge and tools, and prepare them sufficiently to help spread the anti-drug message.
We have stepped up our preventive drug education efforts. We have increased our presence on social media to address misconceptions about drugs. We are developing interactive and engaging content to generate interest in anti-drug messages. Check out our CNB Facebook page. It is pretty fun, it is pretty cool.
We have strong support and help from our anti-drug advocates. They are individuals and organisations who help spread the anti-drug message. They form part of a community passionate about keeping Singapore drug-free.
Rigorous Enforcement
Enforcement is another key pillar in Singapore’s anti-drug strategy. Intensive efforts were invested to suppress drug demand and supply. CNB has done a very good job in keeping the drug situation in Singapore under control. It has crippled drug trafficking syndicates and disrupted the supply of drugs into Singapore through joint operations with other local and foreign law enforcement agencies. It is very interesting. In fact, I followed CNB on a couple of drug raids and it was quite an experience for me.
Tough Laws
Our enforcement efforts are supported by tough laws. We believe that tough laws form an integral part of the fight against drug trafficking and abuse. We are tough on traffickers and we will continue to be tough. If we soften our position on drugs, more drug syndicates and traffickers will enter Singapore. We cannot allow this to happen.
Effective Treatment, Rehabilitation and Aftercare
Rehabilitating drug offenders is another key strategy in Singapore’s fight against drug abuse. We have comprehensive programmes in place to treat these drug abusers, and help them stay clean from drugs.
We know that every abuser is different. Abusers come from different backgrounds. They face different pressures. They have different levels of motivation. A one-size-fits-all approach would not work. Hence, we tailor different approaches to meet their needs.
Cooperation
I have spoken about the issues that we face and the measures that we have adopted to overcome them. But the most important ingredient to success, is cooperation. The fight against drugs transcends all national boundaries.
Organised criminal groups are becoming more sophisticated. They are not bound by boundaries. They do not operate on morals and principles. They are always thinking of how to outsmart law enforcement agencies.
We cannot counter them effectively if we do not join forces. We must continue with our efforts and our collaboration, to find solutions on bilateral and multilateral issues through Colombo Plan’s principles of self-help and mutual help, and to keep on encouraging each other to reduce drug demand and supply.
I would like to encourage all of you to make use of this opportunity to share your national strategies and programmes addressing drug use, the current drug trends, and the challenges that you face. The knowledge that we can get from each other would be very valuable in informing the approaches we should take and to overcome the obstacles that we face in each of our countries.
Preventive Drug Education and Re-integration into society
Drug abuse destroys families, weakens the workforce, and has bad effects on health. We must step up our efforts in preventive drug education and rehabilitation. We need to protect our young people from these false messages tempting them to take drugs. We must continue to invest in rehabilitation programmes. To help ex-abusers kick their drug habits, and turn their lives around.
The Colombo Plan has been active by taking the lead in spearheading preventive education and rehabilitation programmes. The treatment and rehabilitation network established by the Colombo Plan has been very effective. Communities enjoy enhanced treatment, rehabilitation and aftercare facilities. Communities can participate in programmes that are customised to their social and cultural context. Countries have benefitted from the many training programmes. For example, the Colombo Plan’s Youth Network trains youth leaders to initiate drug prevention projects. The emphasis placed by the Colombo Plan on preventive education and rehabilitation is a recognition of the need to take a holistic approach to address the drug problem.
Conclusion
Thank you very much for your efforts and commitment to this fight against drugs. We have made very good progress and I am confident that together we can achieve even more.
I would like to show our appreciation to the Secretary-General of Colombo Plan, Mr Kinley Dorji, and the CEO of Colombo Plan, Mr Thomas Browne for their leadership all these years.
I wish everyone a fruitful meeting.
Thank you very much.

270,2.1kg of heroin seized; six arrested,2017-08-02,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/2.1kg-of-heroin-seized-six-arrested," In an operation conducted on 1-August, the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested six suspected drug offenders and seized about 2.1kg of heroin, some 'Ice' and Erimin-5. The seizure is estimated to be worth about S$150,000.
In the afternoon of 1 August, CNB officers were deployed to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker - a 42-year-old male Singaporean. CNB officers spotted the 42-year-old male picking up another male suspect - a 35-year-old male Singaporean,
and trailed them to a carpark in the Changi area.
The 35-year-old male subsequently met up with two males (23 year-old and 27 year-old), both Malaysians, at a coffeeshop in the vicinity. The 35-year-old male left the coffeeshop a short while later, carrying a bag. CNB officers arrested him and recovered
about 1,360g of heroin from the bag. Another party of officers moved in swiftly to arrest the two male Malaysians and a total of S$2,400 was recovered from them.
Officers proceeded to raid the 35-year-old’s hideout along Changi Road, and arrested the 42-year-old male Singaporean within the unit. About 280g of heroin and 16g of 'Ice' were recovered from within the unit. A 61-year-old male Singaporean suspected
drug abuser was also arrested within the unit. CNB officers conducted a search of the car driven by the 42-year-old male Singaporean and recovered about 450g of heroin from within the car.
CNB officers then proceeded to raid the hideout of the 42-year-old male Singaporean, in the Woodlands Crescent area where about 30g of heroin, three Erimin-5 tablets and some drug paraphernalia were recovered from within the unit. A 42-year-old female
Singaporean suspected drug abuser was also arrested in the unit.
Investigations into the arrested drug offenders are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient
to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week*.

The 38th Meeting of ASEAN Senior Officials on Drug Matters (ASOD) was held in Hanoi, Vietnam, from 25 to 26 July 2017. The meeting was opened by Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of Public Security, Mr Le Quy Vuong, on 25 July. Singapore’s delegation
    at the 38th ASOD was led by Mr Ng Ser Song, Director, Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), and comprised representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Central Narcotics Bureau and Singapore Prison Service.


At a press conference held after the conclusion of the meeting, Director CNB Mr Ng shared with Vietnam media on CNB’s assessment on new drug trends, including the growing threat of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and online drug trafficking.
    He also shared with the media Singapore’s firm and comprehensive strategy of dealing with drugs, which includes upstream preventive drug education, tough laws and robust enforcement, and strong community partnerships on the rehabilitation and
    aftercare of drug offenders (please see Annex A for Director CNB Mr Ng’s statement).

Annex-A
“Every country faces unique drug situations and challenges. As anti-narcotic agencies, we try our best to address these challenges to the best of our capabilities.
Singapore adopts a firm stance against drugs. We keep the drug situation under control by tackling both drug demand and supply. Our comprehensive approach of upstream preventive drug education, tough laws and robust enforcement, and strong community partnerships
on the rehabilitation and aftercare of drug offenders has worked well for us. We focus on harm prevention, and not on harm reduction. Singaporeans appreciate the protection this policy gives to our children and youth.
Due to Singapore’s location as a major transport hub, it increases the risk of drugs being smuggled into and through our borders. Hence, we need to ensure that our laws are tough and effective in deterring drug traffickers.
There has been calls of legalization in the global war against drugs. We have seen this being debated at international forums and have been keeping abreast of the arguments and reasons put forward by supporters of a softer approach to drugs. However,
thus far, we are not convinced that these approaches such as legalization, is a viable solution.
There is a growing debate on legalising illicit drugs. Some of the reasons put forward have been that legalization will eliminate illicit markets and reduce the costs borne by criminal justice systems. However, it is a sweeping statement that legalization
would resolve problems caused by drugs. There is no quick-fix solution in addressing the drug problem. In fact, what we need is a firm resolve and commitment of efforts and resources to implement a balanced, holistic and integrated strategy which targets
both demand and supply.
Ultimately, when faced with arguments for softer approaches, we need to keep in mind that drugs are harmful and there are repercussions for both the individual, his family and society. We cannot allow the normalization of drug abuse to take root. This
is why Singapore remains committed to ASEAN’s shared vision of a region free of drug abuse. As an ASEAN bloc, we are united and have come out strongly against drugs. This is evident in the joint ASEAN statement which was delivered at the 59th
Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
Operationally, we have noticed the increased use of online drug trafficking. To address this challenge of online drug activities, we have adopted a three-pronged strategy. First, we collect upstream intelligence by monitoring open source reports and exchange
information with our national and international counterparts. Second, we conduct downstream enforcement where we conduct joint operations with our Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to target parcels arriving from prevailing source countries.
Third, we develop capabilities and partnerships with the relevant stakeholders such as postal companies, and work with them and ICA to enhance detection capabilities. The threat of online drug trafficking with likely continue to be a concern as our
society gets increasingly digitized. We will continue to keep a close watch on the issue.
One of the key challenges we have faced in recent years is the emergence of NPS, which develop faster than the time taken to schedule them in local legislation. In some cases, this result in the substances being in circulation, causing harm, long before
the processes to schedule the drugs are completed. In response, we have enhanced our legislation to control and prevent their proliferation. NPS can be temporarily listed in our law for 12 months, with the possibility of extension by another 12 months.
Law enforcement agencies are empowered to seize these NPS whilst research and industry consultations take place to study the harmful effects of the substances and if there were possible legitimate uses. After a year, all temporarily-listed NPS would
be re-classified as Class A controlled drugs if they were found to have no legitimate uses.
Addressing the drug problem is a shared responsibility. Cooperation amongst counter narcotics agencies in the region is paramount in our efforts to eradicate drugs.”  Photo-1: Group photo of Heads of delegations at the 38th ASOD meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, 25 July 2017.

On 12 April 2012, Prabagaran was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint after 2 packets containing not less than 22.24 grams of diamorphine were recovered from the Malaysian-registered vehicle that he was driving.  On 22 July 2014, Prabagaran was convicted of importing 22.24 grams of diamorphine (or pure heroin) into Singapore.  He was sentenced to death by the High Court on 22 September 2014.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine imported is more than 15 grams. 22.24 grams of diamorphine is equivalent to about 1,853 straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 265 abusers for a week.[1]
His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 2 October 2015.
On 8 January 2016, Prabagaran brought his case to the Court of Appeal for the second time by way of a criminal motion for the Court of Appeal to review its decisions on his appeal, on grounds that the Misuse of Drugs Act provisions under which he was sentenced to death were unconstitutional.  On 2 December 2016, the criminal motion was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
On 11 July 2017, Prabagaran’s case was brought before the Court of Appeal for the third time by way of criminal motions on grounds that Prabagaran has a pending appeal before the Malaysian Court of Appeal to institute proceedings against Singapore in the International Court of Justice.  On 13 July 2017, the criminal motions were dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
Prabagaran submitted his petition for clemency.  The petition was unsuccessful.
Prabagaran was accorded full due process under the law, and he was represented by legal counsel throughout the process.

A separate party of CNB officers were deployed to conduct observation on a 29-year-old suspected drug trafficker whose hideout was in the vicinity of Yishun Avenue 11.  Officers raided the unit and arrested the 29-year-old within and about 138g of ‘Ice’ were recovered from him. 
Swift investigations led officers to another unit in the same vicinity. The unit was raided and four suspected drug abusers – a 23-year-old female, a 22-year-old male, a 26-year-old male and a 49-year-old male, all Singaporeans, were arrested within.  About 60 g of ‘Ice’, a small amount of cannabis and two ‘Ecstasy’ tablets were recovered from within the unit.
Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) provides for the death penalty if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g.  250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week.

The ASITF was initiated by Indonesia at the 35th Meeting of ASEAN Senior Officials on Drug Matters in 2014, and was endorsed by the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters in 2016.
The Task Force was established to combat the movement of illicit drugs through sea routes within ASEAN countries. Increase in trade and transport networks have contributed to increasing volume of trade in the ASEAN region and the wider Asia region.  The United Nations Office on Drugs & Crime (UNODC) reported that about 420 million containers are shipped yearly in the international supply chain. Increased trade and connectivity benefits the ASEAN community.  On the flipside, it also provides more conduits and opportunities for drug syndicates to exploit for their distribution network.  Thus, there is a need for all stakeholders, not just drug enforcement agencies, but also fellow agencies in customs, coast guards, port authorities and logistical solutions providers, to come together to disrupt the illicit activities of these syndicates.
Indonesia launched the first ASITF meeting in 2016 in Batam, Indonesia. CNB hopes to continue the momentum and successes of the first meeting, and facilitate information sharing amongst law enforcement agencies and other regional law enforcement agencies through the 2nd ASITF Meeting. By working together, ASEAN enforcement agencies will be more effective in combating transnational drug trafficking via sea routes, and prevent and deter drug syndicates from using ASEAN countries’ seaports to distribute illicit drugs.

In commemoration of the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on 26 June 2017, around 280 students volunteers from various secondary schools, our very own Anti-Drug Advocates (ADA), CNB officers and United Against Drugs Coalition
    (UADC) partners were involved in a series of activities in the week leading up to 26 June.
The distribution follows immediately after our “Break In” music concert on 16 June where we were “High on Love”* and kicked off the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign 2017!





You may have spotted our enthusiastic and youthful Anti-Drug Advocates (ADA) on 17 June who had assisted to recruit, organise and manage student volunteers. Together with our very own CNB officers, they have given out about 50,000 “Pick A Drug
    Free SG” commemorative items, as part of our island-wide efforts to reach out to members of public in the heartlands and town area, as well as Changi Airport. Do you know that when school reopens, more than 470,000 students will also receive
    this guitar pick with our special message via their schools?

“At CNB, we do not merely play the role of a law enforcer as it is also equally important that we engage the public and educate them on the harmful impact of drugs to effectively achieve a drug-free Singapore.” - Haziq 26





“I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in the distribution as it allows me a fulfilling experience on how it is like to engage members of the public in our anti-drug advocacy.” - Ching Yen, 21
Not forgetting our private corporate partners from the United Against Drugs Coalition (UADC) who had also contributed their efforts. SingPost had helped to connect with residents and commercial buildings in the East through the mail box distribution.
    Both PastaMania and Central Perk Cafe staff had also donned the anti-drug green and white ribbon and distributed the commemorative items to their patrons. Come 26 June, staff from our UADC partners such as Reebonz, SingPost, PastaMania, I am café,
    Tenderfresh and Central Perk will also receive the anti-drug ribbons.





“At PastaMania, we believe in not just creating the flavours that Singapore loves. We also want to have a healthy and drug-free Singapore where everyone can enjoy a delicious meal with their beloved friends and families.”





“There’s nothing better than having group of friends coming together and sharing a common vision — a drug-free home. We are honoured to be able to contribute towards such a meaningful cause.” - Ms Mary Angeline S.Consulta (right), 24, Central Perk Café





“As a postman, I have delivered countless messages over the past 25 years – and #DrugFreeSG is one of the more meaningful ones. I am proud to be part of the fight against drugs.” - Mr Nasri Bin Wasli, 45, Inspector Post, SingPost
Captain Drug Buster Show in collaboration with the National Library Board
We didn’t forget that parents are one of our greatest advocates to start the conversation! The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has collaborated with the National Library Board [NLB] to stage 15 anti-drug skits at public libraries island-wide from
    July to September 2017. The “Captain Drug Buster Show” can help parents and their children between 7 to 12 years old, learn more about the dangers of drug abuse as well as refusal tips. Be the anti-drug champion at home!





Members of public can refer to https://www.cnb.gov.sg/events/current.aspx for information on the dates and locations of the skits. We are having a special Anti-Drug Ambassador facilitated session for bonding between parents and children on 28 July 2017
    at the Bukit Panjang Public Library at 3pm following the skit. Residents in the West can also visit our Drug Buster Academy (bus) at the Jurong Regional Library on 5 August 2017.

The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty for those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis. 1,000g of cannabis is sufficient to feed the addiction
of about 143 drug abusers for a week. The Misuse of Drugs Act also provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient to feed the
addiction of about 180 abusers for a week. Any person convicted of trafficking more than 250g of methamphetamine may also face the death penalty. 250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week. CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) seized nearly 1kg of cannabis in an operation conducted on 12 May 2017. Other drugs including heroin and ‘Ice’ were also seized in the operation.  The cannabis seized is estimated to be worth nearly S$10,000. 


In the late afternoon of 12 May, CNB officers spotted two drug suspects together in the vicinity of Tampines Street 86. The two suspects parted way shortly after and returned to their respective vehicles.  Officers arrested both suspects separately, and a search was conducted on their vehicles.


A block of about 980g of cannabis was recovered from within the car of the first suspect, a 41-year-old male Singaporean. About 20g of ‘Ice’, 16g of heroin, an Erimin-5 tablet and other unknown tablets were recovered from within the car of the second suspect, a 25-year-old male Singaporean.


Following swift investigations, CNB officers arrested a 30-year-old suspected drug abuser, believed to be a drug client of the first suspect [the 41-year-old male], in the vicinity of Redhill Close. A search conducted at the 30-year-old suspect’s residence yielded about 5g of ‘Ice’ and various drug-smoking utensils.  Six improvised air rifles were also recovered.


Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty for those convicted of trafficking in more than 500g of cannabis. 1,000g of cannabis is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 143 drug abusers for a week. The Police are investigating into the seized improvised air rifles.


The Central Narcotics Bureau would like to remind the public that cannabis is a Class A controlled drug listed under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Unauthorised consumption, possession, trafficking, import or export of any Class A controlled drug is an offence.

In late 2016, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) had intelligence pointing to the involvement of two Singaporeans with a Malaysia-based drug syndicate. CNB initiated joint investigations with the Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (NCID) of the
    Royal Malaysian Police (RMP), with a view to arrest the syndicate members and dismantle the syndicate.


During the course of investigations, CNB managed to identify two Singaporean suspects, believed to be coordinating drug supply runs for the syndicate. The information was shared with NCID, which aided NCID in tracking down the two Singaporeans and their
    Malaysian associates. NCID further managed to ascertain the drug storehouses of the syndicate, located in Petaling Jaya.


On 6 May 2017, NCID launched an operation to neutralise the syndicate. Four of the syndicate’s Malaysian members were arrested in Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur. NCID also recovered about 64kg of ‘Ice’, 61.5kg of ketamine and 23,985
    ‘Ecstasy’ tablets.


On the same day, NCID arrested the two Singaporean suspects – a 43-year-old male and a 58-year-old male – in Johor Bahru. The 58-year-old male Singaporean was found to be in possession of 11g of ‘Ice’, 68 Erimin-5 tablets and
    a small amount of ketamine.


Investigations by NCID are ongoing. If convicted of drug trafficking, both Singaporeans may face the death penalty.


Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “I am very glad that CNB’s timely sharing of intelligence with NCID aided NCID in this highly successful operation, which not only saw the seizure of a significant amount of drugs, but also the dismantling
    of a regional drug trafficking syndicate which had its tentacles in a few countries. I would like to reiterate, that the fight against drugs, must be fought with close cooperation between counterparts. No drug enforcement agency can afford to do it
    alone, especially against drug trafficking syndicates which operate near seamlessly between different countries. If drug trafficking syndicates are cooperating this closely, drug enforcement agencies must cooperate even more closely, in order to dismantle
    these syndicates and their deadly trade. I would like to thank Director NCID CP Dato’ Sri Mohd. Mokhtar Bin HJ. Mohd. Shariff and NCID officers for their strong support and cooperation with CNB over the years. Together, we can take the fight
    to the drug syndicates.”

It has come to the attention of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) that there are online reports circulating about the availability of ‘Ecstasy’ (or other drugs) that come in the form of candy or specifically, bear-shaped candy, targeted at the young.


CNB would like to inform the public that reports on such candy-shaped drugs did not originate from CNB.  Locally, CNB has not come across cases of drugs such as ‘Ecstasy’, made to look like candy or specifically, bear-shaped candy.  However, CNB is aware of foreign news reports on such candy-shaped drugs, containing ‘Ecstasy’ or cannabis, circulating overseas, including:

While there is no specific information about drugs such as ‘Ecstasy’ and cannabis that comes in the form of candy, CNB would like to urge parents to remind their children that drugs are harmful and they should not consume anything offered by persons not known to them.  Unscrupulous traffickers may seek to disguise the harmful nature of drugs by making them look like candy or foodstuff.  If you come across such suspected substances, please alert CNB for us to look into the matter.  You can call us at 1800 325 6666 (24 hours) or email us at CNB_Feedback@cnb.gov.sg

On 4 May 2017 at about 1.25pm, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers directed an arriving Malaysia-registered bus for further checks at Woodlands Checkpoint.


During the course of checks, a suspicious bag was found at the right-side of the driver’s seat.  Further investigations by ICA officers led to the identification of two other suspected accomplices.  The bag was opened in the presence of the three suspects and ICA officers uncovered some bundles, suspected to be controlled drugs.  The 36-year-old male Malaysian driver and the two Malaysian men, aged 20 and 24, were subsequently placed under arrest.  The case was handed over to officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).  A total of about 3.7kg of heroin and 1kg of cannabis were seized.  The estimated street worth of the seized drugs is about S$307,000.


CNB launched a follow-up operation to arrest the suspected intended recipients of the seized drugs.  A 35-year-old female Singaporean and a 48-year-old male Singaporean were arrested in the vicinity of Jalan Pelatok, off Upper Changi Road East.  CNB officers proceeded to raid the two suspects’ rented room, also in the vicinity of Jalan Pelatok, and recovered a total of about 260g of ‘Ice’, 130g of heroin, two ‘Yaba’ (methamphetamine) tablets, a small amount of cannabis and a bottle of methadone.


Investigations are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g. 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws [1], which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week. The MDA also provides for the death penalty if the amount of cannabis trafficked exceeds 500g.


Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore's security, and security checks are critical to our nation’s security. The Home Team agencies will continue to conduct checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands.

On 2 May 2017 at about 10.40pm, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers directed an arriving Singapore-registered car, driven by a lone male Singaporean, for further checks at Woodlands Checkpoint.


There were three plastic bags containing different boxes of items in the car.  During inspection, ICA officers uncovered Erimin-5 tablets concealed in a box of washing powder.  Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were alerted and conducted further checks on the other boxes, uncovering a total of about 3.1kg of ‘Ice’, 2kg of cannabis, 1,700 Erimin-5 tablets and 60 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets.  The 35-year-old man was arrested and CNB followed up with an operation to arrest the suspected intended recipients of the seized drugs.


On 3 May 2017 at about 1.10am, CNB officers arrested three suspected drug traffickers in the vicinity of Woodlands Avenue 4.  A search was conducted on the car of the first suspect, a 32-year-old male Singaporean, and officers recovered 17 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 8g of ‘Ice’, cash amounting to S$22,800, a digital weighing scale and numerous empty plastic sachets.


CNB officers also searched the car of the other two suspects, a 27-year-old male Singaporean and a 24-year-old female Singaporean.  Cash amounting to S$12,250 was recovered from within the car.  A search conducted at the Pasir Ris residence of the 27-year-old man recovered small amounts of ‘Ice’, ketamine and cannabis.


At about 5.35am, CNB officers arrested another suspected drug trafficker, a 25-year-old male Singaporean, in the vicinity of Orchard Towers.


Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested suspects are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) provides for the death penalty if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g.  250g of methamphetamine is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 185 abusers for a week.  The MDA also provides for the death penalty if the amount of cannabis trafficked exceeds 500g.

291,Misuse Of Drugs Act (wef 1 May 2017),2017-04-28,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/misuse-of-drugs-act," 
With effect from 1 May 2017, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all four New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) in the First Schedule of the same Act. This means that these substances will be reclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). CNB will also be listing one new psychoactive substance commonly known as U-47700[2] in the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B).


Following the listing of the five NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.


CNB will be listing nine new substances in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex C). This enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.


Global NPS Situation


There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in November 2016 by the World Health Organisation Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, there were at least 730 NPS identified in 2016[3].


Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. The listing of new NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA is a necessary pre-emptive move to restrict the circulation of these harmful substances in our community.

CNB officers
Ladies and Gentlemen
Introduction

I am pleased to join you this morning at the CNB Workplan Seminar 2017.


CNB has achieved much in 2016.


You have worked very hard and seen successes in the areas of preventive drug education, enforcement, international engagement and advocacy.


Thank you for your contributions and efforts in keeping Singapore’s drug situation under control.


Preventive drug education
Preventive drug education, or PDE, remains at the forefront of our strategy in this fight against drugs.


CNB has worked hard in rolling out various PDE initiatives.


CNB has also been reaching out to partners such as teachers, parents and NS Commanders.


CNB produced toolkits to equip them with knowledge on drugs so they can better engage their children and their NSmen to influence and help them stay away from drugs. They are important influencers.


On social media, CNB has enhanced its presence across social media platforms from Facebook, Instagram to YouTube. Social media is an important platform in this new media world.


To spread the anti-drug message, CNB has worked with influential youths. Taufik hits the right notes with “High on Love”. Irfan Fandi scores among the young with his messages on staying drug free.


Drug enforcement
CNB has also done a very good job in enforcement.


CNB dismantled 23 drug trafficking syndicates in 2016.


But the fight against drugs has shifted to a new battleground – the internet.


There are people who hide behind the internet’s anonymity for their drug trade.


On this front, CNB has stepped up efforts to detect and disrupt online drug trade. In 2016, there were 201 persons arrested for buying drugs and drug paraphernalia online, compared to just 30 in 2015.


We should never let up on our efforts to apprehend those who seek to evade the long arm of the law.


Thank you, CNB officers for your sacrifices and hard work in keeping Singapore’s drug situation under control.


Thank you to your families too, for putting up with your long hours at work. Your families have sacrificed. You have given up family time. To save lives. To keep this country drug-free and we have been successful on this count.


International engagement and local advocacy
CNB’s work is not just limited within Singapore’s borders. It has international and regional dimensions. And CNB has also done well in these areas.


CNB worked with its regional counterparts to stem the supply of drugs overseas.


Last year we participated actively at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS), where we stood up for our vision of a drug-free society.


At the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters which Singapore hosted, we took a clear and firm stance against drugs. Together with our ASEAN neighbours, we delivered a joint statement at the Meeting to reaffirm our vision for a Drug-Free
    ASEAN.
    


However we must press on with our efforts. We have to continually engage the international community to ensure that our national interest to maintain a zero-tolerance stand on drugs will not be compromised.


Challenges
We have our work cut out for us, we face many challenges.


The Singapore population is ageing Our manpower supply will be increasingly constrained.


Public expectations are rising. The public wants us to be more efficient, to respond to their queries quickly.


Shifting global trends


Your work is made more difficult by the global drug trends.


Many countries are at risk of liberalising their position on the drug problem. Under pressure from a worsening drug problem in their societies, some governments are moving towards a harm reduction rather than harm prevention approach which is the position
    we are taking in Singapore. This is a dangerous slippery slope.


Many countries are legalising cannabis.


Some parties are trumpeting the so-called “medicinal use” of cannabis. They glamourise drug use, But they do not talk about the harms of drugs.


Youth drug abusers
Locally, we are seeing an increase in the number of young drug abusers arrested. Close to two-thirds of all new abusers arrested were below 30 years old.


Youths are displaying more liberal attitudes towards drugs.


From our interviews with inmates, former drug offenders and youths.


It is clear that the myth that cannabis is harmless has seeped into the minds of some of our youths.


The false messages on drugs are on the internet and are easily accessible to youths.


If we are not careful, we are potentially looking at a new generation of drug abusers.


Transformation is a necessity
The challenges are real. And CNB needs to ready itself for the future.


CNB recognises this and has embarked on a transformative journey to stay ahead of the curve in the fight against drugs.


I will talk about four priorities

Social media
Active citizenry
Technology
Joint operations




Using Social Media to Reach Out to the Youths
First, on social media. We need to further up our game to counter the narrative that drugs are acceptable


The NCADA survey showed that youths preferred receiving information on preventive drug education through social media.


But social media is a double-edged sword, negative online influences can easily corrode the minds of our young.


We have produced several online videos and advertisements to dispel myths on cannabis, but we need to know who and what we are up against.


Blitzy ads selling false info.


Evocative statements spreading lies about drugs. How this is portrayed to be cool.


Our young people are exposed to these. We have to make sure our videos and ads present the real truths.


And we are revamping our social media outreach to better resonate with and engage youths, empower them with information on the harms of drugs and send a clear message that a drug free life is indeed cool. Messages have to be in sync with this generation.


The nature of social media is that it is ever changing so we need to keep up with the times and latest trends. We need to use humour, wit, use youth lingo present information in digestible format, the way our young are used to, to send youths the serious
    and hard messages, to empower them to lead a drug-free lifestyle.


Bottom line, life is precious, we have to live life to the fullest.


Empowering and creation of an active citizenry
Second is active citizenry, to empower our citizens to spread the anti-drug advocacy to compete with the negative voices online.


This war cannot be won by CNB alone.


We need a united network of organisations to endorse and promote Singapore’s anti-drug stance.


Advocacy is our new cornerstone in PDE.


Launch of “United Against Drugs” Coalition
I am encouraged that CNB and NCADA have taken the lead to form a “United Against Drugs” Coalition. Bringing together the different organisations in the anti-drug ecosystem to support the drug-free cause.


Today, we launch this new initiative to raise awareness of drug abuse in our society and rally support from different organisations to advocate for a drug-free Singapore.


We want to expand our reach to even more organisations to join this platform.


I want to take this opportunity to welcome KFC, PastaMania, Gong Cha, Clarke Quay, Central Perk café, Tenderfresh, SingPost, Fat Papa’s Burger, “I am” café and Reebonz.


They are well-known names and brands, that youths are familiar with. They are brands who understand the importance of youths leading drug-free lifestyles.


I would also like to thank our traditional partners MINDEF, MOE, MSF, self-help organisations, and schools for their continued support.


We hope more organisations like them will join us to promote this anti-drug cause


Anti-drug Advocacy Network
We also want to unite individuals who are passionate about keeping Singapore drug-free.


We want to tap on the voices of friends, colleagues and mentors to promote a drug-free lifestyle. Together, we can be louder than those voices who are asking for a liberalisation of drug policies.


We are thankful that we have advocates like Dr Roger Ho and Dr Melvyn Zhang.


They have both contributed to our advocacy efforts by developing a PDE mobile app with their medical students, to educate youths on the harms of drugs.


We hope for more passionate individuals like them to join us, and share their skills and expertise to promote a drug-free lifestyle.


Harnessing the power of technology
Third, to harness the power of technology.


CNB is transforming itself through technology.


CNB’s unified Investigation and Case Management System is an excellent example. It allows officers the flexibility to share information digitally and to collaborate with external agencies to process cases in a timely and efficient manner.


We need to automate even more functions To reduce the amount of manual tasks So that our officers can better focus on their core work.


Integrating the Home Team’s operations
Next, we need to better integrate Home Team’s operations.


The operations centres of the different Home Team Departments will be co-located together as one Home Team Operations Centre starting later this year. This will enhance the way we communicate and share information across the Home Team departments.


It will allow for better coordination of joint responses to incidents. It will enable the Home Team departments to respond and work better together.


These are just some examples of CNB’s transformative initiatives in the four priority areas which have started or are in the pipeline.


Conclusion
To conclude, let us work closely together to weed out drug abuse in our society This fight is not going to be easy. It will be a long and hard process.


But I can be confident that with the dedication, professionalism, and resourcefulness of CNB and its officers, supported by its partners and the community, that we will be able to achieve success.


I wish all of you a fruitful workplan seminar.


Thank you.

The UADC is a network of organisations from the government,
non-government and private sector which have pledged their commitment to the anti-drug cause and will help to spread the anti-drug message within their networks and spheres of influence. [See Annex A for more information].
Ms Selena Chong, Vice President, Corporate Sustainability, SingPost said “The popularity of eCommerce means larger numbers of parcels are now moving across borders through mail and parcel delivery systems.  SingPost stands with CNB in the fight against drugs and drug abuse.  We are committed to be vigilant in our inspection and screening processes to detect concealed narcotics, and also collaborate with CNB as part of the United Against Drugs Coalition.”
In the area of enforcement, CNB will look to increasingly leverage on technology, to assist officers to better carry out their duties. One of the technological initiatives is the Automated Image Processing System [AIPS], which leverages on robotic technology
to automate the image processing process. The AIPS is able to automatically back-up, label, print and bind photograph albums for operational usage in a one-stop workstation for all image-processing needs and achieve greater resource optimisation.
Director CNB, Mr Ng Ser Song, said: “The way CNB approaches PDE has changed, with focus on educating and engaging the community, and on co-creation of content with stakeholders, so as to develop and maintain self-sustaining advocacy networks. We
are also reaching out to anti-drug advocates and hope more will come on board. CNB will remain steadfast on our anti-drug stance, and with the help of all our partners, we will ensure that our message reach out to even more people to secure a drug-free
future for Singapore.”

294,62 arrested in CNB 4-day island-wide operation,2017-04-21,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/62-arrested-in-cnb-4-day-island-wide-operation," In yet another island-wide operation carried out by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) from 17 April to morning of 21 April 2017, a total of 62 suspected drug offenders were arrested.  A total of about 1,930g of heroin, 950g of ‘Ice’,
1,560g of cannabis, 1,087 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 595 Erimin-5 tablets and 80g of ketamine were seized.  The haul of drugs seized is estimated to be more than S$313,000.
The operation was supported by the Singapore Police Force, and the areas covered included Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bukit Panjang, Chai Chee, Geylang, Jurong, Punggol, Sengkang, West Coast and Woodlands. 
Large haul of heroin & ‘Ice’ seized
In one of the cases during this island-wide operation, CNB officers arrested two suspected drug traffickers and seized a total of about 1kg of heroin, 200g of ‘Ice’, 90 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets and 11 Erimin-5 tablets. 
On 17 April 2017, CNB officers arrested a 32-year-old male and a 38-year-old female – both Singaporeans – in the vicinity of Woodlands Square.  They were brought to their rented car and a search of the car recovered about 920g of heroin,
21 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, a small amount of ‘Ice’ and drug-taking utensils. 
A search of the male suspect recovered various drugs including 57g of ‘Ice’, 63 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 11 Erimin-5 tablets and a small amount of heroin.
Both suspects were then brought to their hideout, a unit in a private apartment in the vicinity of Stevens Road.  A search of the unit recovered about 111g of heroin, 138g of ‘Ice’ and six ‘Ecstasy’ tablets. 
Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested persons are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g.  15g of diamorphine is equivalent
to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.  This is estimated using a typical purity level of 4%, based on drug seizures in recent years.
Mr Ong Pang Thong, Director Enforcement Sector-I, CNB, said: “CNB will not let-up on our enforcement efforts against drugs and drug abuse.  However, CNB needs the continued support of the community, especially parents, to actively help us in
spreading and reinforcing the anti-drug message.  Parents should start the conversation on drugs early with their child to guide them away from drugs.  Parents can keep themselves updated on the tips to engage their child using CNB’s
preventive drug education portal, at http://www.cnb.gov.sg/cnbpde/parents/default.aspx.

As shared by Dato’ Mokhtar, illicit drug trafficking is a global threat, and no country is spared from the harms it inflicts.  Drug trafficking syndicates take advantage of increasing globalisation and advances in technology to expand their trade, with the aim of achieving maximum profits.  Against such a well-connected adversary, it is all the more important, that fellow drug enforcement agencies cooperate with each other, in order to achieve maximum impact.  In 2016 and 2015, CNB and NCID cooperated on eight joint operations to dismantle drug trafficking syndicates and drug distribution networks.
The emergence and proliferation of New Psychoactive Substances or NPS, adds to the challenges faced by all drug enforcement agencies.  According to the UNODC, there were at least 643 NPS identified as at 2015, a significant increase from 126 in 2009.  Against such a fast-evolving situation, law enforcement agencies must enhance cooperation and share information, knowledge and best practices to strengthen our collective efforts in the fight against illicit drugs.
CNB and NCID have been working closely for many years and our combined efforts have resulted in many successes.  Today we conclude our 64th bilateral meeting, and this is truly a testament to our close and enduring ties.  I look forward to many more years of cooperation between the two agencies, and many more successes ahead of us. 
Once again, I would like to thank Director NCID Dato’ Mokhtar and NCID staff, for their continued confidence and trust in CNB.  With NCID’s close and firm support, we are confident of continuing the good fight against the drug syndicates.”

and coordinate their fight against drugs.
Transnational drug trafficking is a common threat to all countries and our region faces continuing challenges in the production and trafficking of illicit drugs.  Drug trafficking syndicates respect no national boundaries.  In their pursuit
of monetary gains, they have no regard for human lives and cause irreparable harm to our communities through their illicit drug trafficking activities.  No country or region is spared or immune.
To deal with the threat of transnational illicit drug trafficking, it is imperative that law enforcement agencies in the region cooperate in combating these syndicates.  It is only by working together that drug enforcement agencies can fight the
drug war more effectively.  At the 5th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters (AMMD) held in October 2016, all ASEAN Member States reaffirmed their commitment to a Drug-free ASEAN and adopted the new ASEAN Work Plan to Secure Communities
Against Illicit Drugs (2016-2025).
ASEAN drug enforcement agencies have also reinforced our operational networks through regional mechanisms such as the ASEAN Airport and Seaport Interdiction Task Forces to elevate our response in intercepting drugs smuggled through air and sea routes.
In 2017, CNB will be hosting the 2nd ASEAN Seaport Interdiction Task Force meeting, which is an important initiative initiated by Indonesia.  Besides such multi-lateral cooperation platforms, bilateral cooperation mechanisms such as the CNB-NCID
bilateral meetings also serve to enhance the cooperation between law enforcement agencies.
 
Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “In today’s increasingly globalised world, no drug enforcement agency can rely solely on their efforts to fight against drugs.  Cooperation between agencies is imperative.  CNB and NCID have been
working closely for many years and our cooperation has yielded many successes.  I would like to thank Director NCID CP Dato’ Sri Mohd. Mokhtar Bin HJ. Mohd. Shariff and NCID officers for their unwavering support in our fight against a common

This was the message CNB’s anti-drug advocate and Team Singapore athlete Irfan Fandi had for youth, during a special anti-drug themed Saturday Night Lights event. Saturday Night Lights is a prosocial football programme for at-risk
youth, organised by SportCares Foundation (SportCares). This is the first in a new collaboration between CNB and SportCares, as CNB continues to work with key community partners to spread the anti-drug message to youth.
The special event was held at Bishan Stadium, where Irfan Fandi joined 50 SportCares youth at a football training session. The event sought to use sport to spread the anti-drug message, underscoring its importance in empowering youth to lead a healthy,
drug-free lifestyle. Irfan also mingled with the youth, sharing about his interest in football and the importance of a healthy lifestyle. Irfan said, “I had a great time bonding with the Saturday Night Lights footballers through a sport
we all enjoy. Football has brought so much purpose to my life, and I’m glad to be playing with other youth who enjoy the sport as much as I do.”
The event culminated with a series of friendly games. There was friendly rivalry as Irfan and former National defender, Noh Rahman, each led mash-up teams comprising youth from SportCares and Delta League. Mr Kerk Kim Por, Director of SportCares said,
“It was heartening to see our SportCares youth being so receptive to Irfan and the messages he shared. Through our sport programmes, we have seen how important friendships among youth can be. Beyond the fun times they share together, they also
have great influence on each other’s decisions. From today’s session, we hope to remind them to always choose a fulfilling, drug-free life, and also encourage the people around them to do the same.”
Ms Gillian Ong, Director Communications at CNB, also said “Partnering the community continues to be one of the key prongs of CNB’s preventive education outreach. We are always looking for new ways to reach out to youth to stay drug-free, and
we are very glad for SportCares’ support in this new partnership, where youth can come together through sports to promote a healthy and drug-free lifestyle. It was great to see the youth enjoying themselves and learning from Irfan. We hope more
youth will continue to join us for such events, and help keep Singapore drug-free.”
Moving forward, CNB and SportCares hopes to expand the partnership further by organising more anti-drug sports activities, and engaging at-risk youth through sport.

CNB would like to remind the public that cannabis is a Class A controlled drug listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act. Unauthorised consumption, possession, trafficking, import or export of any Class A controlled drug is an offence.
There have been claims made about the efficacy of cannabis as a medicine. However, such claims are inconclusive and unproven. Experts from Singapore’s Institute of Mental Health had conducted an independent literature review on cannabis, where more
than 500 articles from reputable medical journals were studied. Their findings were clear, that cannabis is harmful and addictive, especially to young people; and that half of the daily users of cannabis develop a dependence on cannabis. Cannabis can
also cause irreversible damage to a person’s brain development. Half of the daily users of cannabis develop a dependence on cannabis. For more details, you can find out more from: Press Releases 59th Session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs

            In the latest island-wide anti-drug operation carried out by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), from the morning of 27 August to the morning of 31 August 2018, 82 suspected drug offenders were arrested and about 165g of ‘Ice’, 91g of New Psychoactive Substances, 14g of heroin, 3g of ketamine, nine ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, six Erimin-5 tablets and three bottles containing methadone were seized.  2        This island-wide operation was supported by the Singapore Police Force and some of the areas covered included Ang Mo Kio, Boon Lay, Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang, Geylang, Hougang, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Telok Blangah and Yishun. Drug hideout in Telok Blangah busted 3         In one of the cases during this island-wide operation, in the afternoon of 29 August, CNB officers raided a unit in the vicinity of Telok Blangah Crescent and arrested a 25-year-old male suspected drug trafficker and a 24-year-old female suspected drug abuser within the unit.  Both suspects are Singaporeans. A total of about 32g of ‘Ice’ were recovered from within the unit. The three-month-old baby girl of the female suspect was with the suspect during the raid. Preliminary investigations found that the female suspect had continued to abuse ‘Ice’ during her pregnancy and after the child was born.  The Bureau has worked with the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s Child Protective Service to ensure that the baby receives continued care by an extended family member and is supported in the community with services. Suspected drug trafficker assaulted CNB officers 4         In the early hours of 31 August, CNB officers apprehended a suspected drug trafficker in the vicinity of Jalan Tenteram.  Prior to the arrest, the suspect, a 30-year-old Singaporean male, refused to comply with lawful orders given by the officers.  He started throwing punches at the officers and also attempted to choke an officer.  Necessary force was effected to restrain and place the suspect under arrest.  Prior to a search of suspect’s car, he then passed out and an ambulance was activated to convey the suspect to hospital.  A subsequent search of the car saw about 25g of ‘Ice’, a small packet of ketamine, one Erimin-5 tablet and several improvised drug-smoking apparatuses recovered.  The five CNB officers who were assaulted have received outpatient treatment.  The Police are investigating into the assault on the CNB officers. 5         Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested persons are ongoing.   CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

A total of eight men, all Singaporeans, were arrested in this operation. The operation was supported by the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force and the Health Sciences Authority.   2          In the afternoon of 18 July 2018, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were deployed in the vicinity of Bukit Batok Street 34 to conduct observation on a suspected drug trafficker, a 33-year-old male believed to be dealing in synthetic cannabis.   3          At about 1.30pm, the 33-year-old suspect was spotted meeting up with another suspect, a 47-year-old male, inside a car. The two parted shortly after. The 47-year-old male was tailed in his car to the vicinity of Norris Road, where he was arrested upon alighting. About 506g of powder believed to be a New Psychoactive Substance (NPS) was found on the rear car seat.

Three suspected drug abusers – a 32-year-old, a 41-year-old and a 42-year-old were also arrested within the unit. During the arrest, the 32-year-old suspected drug abuser put up a violent struggle and necessary force was effected to restrain him.

Officers proceeded to raid the unit of the two suspects and from within the unit, 22g of powder believed to be NPS and 188g of synthetic cannabis were seized. Prior to the search, a 25-year-old suspected drug abuser had approached the unit and was promptly arrested.     6          The 33-year-old male was eventually arrested in the vicinity of Bukit Batok West Avenue 7.  He was brought to his residence in Bukit Batok Street 34 and from within the unit, officers recovered about 807g of powder believed to be NPS, 207g of vegetable matter believed to be synthetic cannabis and 2 litres of liquid believed to be acetone.

3          A 24-year-old Singaporean male suspect was believed to have booked a room at a hotel in the vicinity of Raffles Boulevard.  With the assistance of the security team at the hotel, CNB officers raided the room booked by the suspect, a 24-year-old Singaporean male.  As the room was locked from within, forced entry was effected.  Upon entry, officers sighted the 24-year-old male suspect, together with two other suspects – a 22-year-old female foreign national and a 30-year-old Singaporean male, and immediately moved in to effect arrest.  Both male suspects struggled violently to resist arrest and necessary force was used to restrain them.

6          Follow-up investigations led to the arrest of two other suspects – a 41-year-old stateless male and a 62-year-old Singaporean male – who were believed to be associated with the 48-year-old stateless male.
 
7          Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.  2.5kg of heroin is enough to feed the addiction of about 1,190 abusers for a week[*].  2kg of cannabis is enough to feed the addiction of about 286 abusers for a week.

This means that these 21 substances will be reclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). CNB will also be listing four other NPS in the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B).
 
2.       Following the listing of the 25 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.
 
3.        CNB will be listing five NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex C). This allows CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.
 
Global NPS Situation
 
4.         There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in March 2018 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 779 NPS identified by end 2017.[**]
 
5.         Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB regularly reviews strategies to improve detection and regulation of NPS, including regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are currently controlled under the MDA.

Reference: 
 
The Fifth Schedule of the MDA was first enacted on 1 May 2013 to allow CNB to control and prevent the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. The Fifth Schedule enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. These processes are necessary before a substance is classified as a controlled drug. The trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of any substance, which is temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule, will not constitute an offence under the MDA, until that substance is listed as a controlled drug in the First Schedule.

[*] New psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances which produce the same (or similar) effects as controlled drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, “ecstasy”, methamphetamine or heroin.


[**] UNODC Global Smart Update (Vol 19, March 2018). Understanding the synthetic drug market: the NPS factor. 

             With effect from 1 May 2018, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all 21 New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[*] currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) in the First Schedule of the same Act. This means that these 21 substances will be reclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). CNB will also be listing four other NPS in the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B).   2.       Following the listing of the 25 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.   3.        CNB will be listing five NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex C). This allows CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.   Global NPS Situation   4.         There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in March 2018 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 779 NPS identified by end 2017.[**]   5.         Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB regularly reviews strategies to improve detection and regulation of NPS, including regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are currently controlled under the MDA.    CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU 30 APRIL 2018       Reference:    The Fifth Schedule of the MDA was first enacted on 1 May 2013 to allow CNB to control and prevent the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. The Fifth Schedule enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. These processes are necessary before a substance is classified as a controlled drug. The trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of any substance, which is temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule, will not constitute an offence under the MDA, until that substance is listed as a controlled drug in the First Schedule.       Annex A   The Fifth Schedule Drugs Relisted to the First Schedule as Class A Controlled Drugs (With effect from 1 May 2018)         Annex B   Substances Listed to the First Schedule as Class A Controlled Drug (with effect from 1 May 2018)     Annex C   New Substances Listed in the Fifth Schedule (with effect from 1 May 2018)   The following compounds, including any salt or stereoisomeric form of such compounds, and any preparation or product containing such compounds:       [*] New psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances which produce the same (or similar) effects as controlled drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, “ecstasy”, methamphetamine or heroin.

2          On 3 April 2018, CNB and NCID received intelligence that a consignment of drugs will be coming into Singapore. 
Launch of operation by CNB
3          In the late afternoon of 3 April 2018, CNB officers deployed in the vicinity of Alexandra Retail Centre (ARC) spotted a 45-year-old Singaporean male suspected drug trafficker driving a car to the fourth level of the ARC carpark.  Another suspected drug trafficker, a 55-year old Singaporean male, was a passenger in the car.  A while later, officers spotted two other suspects - a 25-year-old and a 27-year-old, both Malaysian males - arriving at the same carpark on a Malaysia-registered motorcycle.  After parking the motorcycle, the 27-year-old Malaysian passenger on the motorcycle was observed going to the fourth level of the carpark.
4          A short while later, all four suspects left the carpark on their respective vehicles.  The two Singaporean suspects were arrested along Alexandra Road.  In an attempt to evade arrest, the 45-year-old Singaporean fell and hit his head on the road kerb.  He was subsequently conveyed to hospital and was discharged after medical observation.  About 470g of heroin was recovered from within the glove compartment of the car.

9          Investigations into the drug activities of all the six suspects arrested in Singapore are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g and if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g.  2,850g of heroin, which is the amount of heroin seized in CNB’s operation, is enough to feed the addiction of about 1,357 abusers for a week[1].  525g of ‘Ice’ is enough to feed the addiction of about 300 abusers for a week[2].  The estimated worth of the heroin and ‘Ice’ seized in Singapore is about S$347,000.
10        Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “This joint operation is yet another testament to the close and effective cooperation between CNB and NCID, and the trust and rapport between the two agencies and our officers.  As a result of the intensive investigations by and close coordination between CNB and NCID, we have managed to dismantle a drug syndicate that was supplying sizeable amount of drugs to Singapore, and also prevented a large amount of drugs from flowing onto the streets of Singapore.  I would like to reiterate, that the fight against drugs must be fought with close cooperation between counterparts.  No drug enforcement agency can do it alone.  I would like to thank Director NCID Datuk Seri Mohmad Bin Salleh and NCID officers for their continuing strong support and cooperation with CNB over the years, and look forward to more shared success in the future.”

Photos-4 & 5 (NCID): Heroin seized by NCID in Johor on 4 April 2018. 9          Investigations into the drug activities of all the six suspects arrested in Singapore are ongoing.  The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15g and if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250g.  2,850g of heroin, which is the amount of heroin seized in CNB’s operation, is enough to feed the addiction of about 1,357 abusers for a week[1].  525g of ‘Ice’ is enough to feed the addiction of about 300 abusers for a week[2].  The estimated worth of the heroin and ‘Ice’ seized in Singapore is about S$347,000. 10        Director CNB Mr Ng Ser Song said, “This joint operation is yet another testament to the close and effective cooperation between CNB and NCID, and the trust and rapport between the two agencies and our officers.  As a result of the intensive investigations by and close coordination between CNB and NCID, we have managed to dismantle a drug syndicate that was supplying sizeable amount of drugs to Singapore, and also prevented a large amount of drugs from flowing onto the streets of Singapore.  I would like to reiterate, that the fight against drugs must be fought with close cooperation between counterparts.  No drug enforcement agency can do it alone.  I would like to thank Director NCID Datuk Seri Mohmad Bin Salleh and NCID officers for their continuing strong support and cooperation with CNB over the years, and look forward to more shared success in the future.”   CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU

Operation leading to the arrest of 5 suspects and seizures amounting to more than 700g of heroin

2          In the late afternoon of 19 March, CNB officers arrested a 45-year-old Singaporean male suspected drug trafficker in the vicinity of Syed Alwi Road.  About 7g of ‘Ice’ was recovered from the male suspect.  Officers proceeded to raid the Rowell Road hideout of the 45-year-old male, where about 358g of heroin, 19g of cannabis, 2g of ‘Ice’ and a digital weighing scale were recovered from within the unit.  The 45-year-old Singaporean male revealed that his drug supplier is a 52-year-old male Singaporean drug trafficker.

3               Follow-up investigations found that the hideout of the 52-year-old suspect was at Bedok North.  CNB officers redeployed to the vicinity of Bedok North Road to conduct observation, and they spotted a 31-year-old Singaporean male arriving at a carpark on a motorcycle. The male suspect loitered suspiciously at the void deck of a block before entering a lift, and proceeding to the eighth floor.  Shortly thereafter, the 31-year-old came down in the lift with the 52-year-old male and another female suspect.  CNB officers moved in and arrested all three suspects – the 31-year-old male motorcyclist, the 52-year-old male trafficker and the 38-year-old female - after they exited the lift.

4                 From within the lift, officers recovered a total of about 373g of heroin. CNB officers also recovered about 2g of ‘Ice’ from the 31-year-old male’s motorcycle. Officers proceeded to raid the hideout of the 52-year-old male and arrested a 56-year-old male suspected drug abuser within the unit.

Operation leading to the arrest of 2 drug suspects and about 480g of heroin and 125 g of ‘Ice’

5                 In a separate operation on the morning of 20 March 2018, CNB officers were deployed to conduct observations on 2 suspected drug traffickers at Fifth Avenue. The two suspects were seen meeting and then parted ways in their motorcycles. Officers proceeded to trail both suspects and arrested one of them, a 24-year old Malaysian male, along Bukit Timah Expressway, under the Eco-Link Bridge. An envelope containing S$5,900 was recovered from his motorcycle.

6               Officers followed the other suspect, a 26-year-old male, along the West Coast Highway. To evade arrest, he travelled at a high speed and rode against the flow of traffic when he entered the Ayer Rajah Expressway. He later beat a red light at a traffic junction off Pioneer Road North, and his reckless riding resulted in him knocking down a 36-year-old male member of public who was crossing the road.

7           The 36-year-old member of public sustained minor injuries and was immediately conveyed to the hospital for medical attention. He is currently warded for observation. A CNB officer also sustained abrasions in the course of the pursuit. Four bundles of drugs consisting about 480g of heroin, 125g of “Ice” and 50 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets were recovered at the accident scene.

8            The 26-year-old’s motorcycle was later found abandoned in a carpark at Jurong West Avenue 5. Shortly after, he was arrested in the vicinity of Pioneer Polyclinic. A raid on his residence further uncovered about 120g of heroin, 1g of ‘Ice’, 65 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 20 Erimin-5 tablets and 5g of cannabis. 

9          Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. The 26-year-old male is also being investigated by police for possible traffic-related offences. 1,331g of heroin is enough to feed the addiction of about 634 abusers for a week[1].

356,"Suspected Drug Syndicate Leader and 4 Drug Offenders Arrested; Drugs Seized Worth More Than S$166,000",2018-03-07,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/suspected-drug-syndicate-leader-and-4-drug-offenders-arrested,"           The Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) dismantled a local drug trafficking syndicate and seized a total of 1,375 grams of “Ice”, including ‘Ice’ that had been dyed red, 548 Erimin-5 tablets, 413 “Ecstasy” tablets, 275 grams of cannabis, 72 grams of ketamine and 2 grams of heroin. The total estimated worth of the drugs seized is more than S$166,000.

2         On the early morning of 6 March 2018 before daybreak, CNB officers were deployed at the vicinity of Punggol Drive to keep a lookout of a 34-year-old Singaporean male suspected drug trafficker, who was believed to be the leader of a local drug syndicate. He was spotted driving his car while his associate, a 38-year-old Singaporean male, was seen driving another car with two other Singaporean male and female associates aged 45 and 37 respectively. 

3         When officers moved in to arrest the subjects in their vehicles, the 34-year-old male attempted to evade arrest. The rest of the associates were arrested on the spot. Officers pursued the 34-year-old in his car, which was subsequently found abandoned in the vicinity of Tebing Lane. Officers embarked on a search and later arrested the 34-year-old under a bridge along Punggol Promenade Riverside Walk. Upon retracing the escape route, officers found 2 disposed packets, a total of about 1,000 grams of “Ice”. A raid on the subject’s residence at Punggol Drive recovered another 243 grams of “Ice”, 516 Erimin-5 tablets, 390 “Ecstasy” pills and 200 grams of cannabis.

4          Meanwhile, a search on the 38-year-old’s vehicle as well as the three subjects’ hideouts and residences uncovered about 70 grams of cannabis, 50 grams of “Ice”, 2 grams of heroin, 23 Erimin-5 tablets, 2 grams of ketamine, 2 “Ecstasy” tablets and drug utensils.

5          A follow-up operation was mounted immediately and CNB officers arrested another 42-year-old Singaporean male, believed to be a member of the same syndicate. A total of about 82 grams of “Ice”, 70 grams of ketamine, 21 “Ecstasy” tablets, 9 Erimin-5 pills and about 5 grams of cannabis were recovered from his residence at Punggol Field.

6          Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250 grams. CNB spokesman said, “CNB had neutralized a drug trafficking syndicate that is capable of distributing significant amount of drugs to the local market. The amount of ‘Ice’ seized in this operation (1,375 grams) can feed the addiction of about 786 abusers for a week. 275 grams of cannabis feeds the addiction of about 39 abusers a week. CNB will continue its relentless efforts against drug traffickers who seek only to profit at the expense of our society by disregarding the destruction they cause to individuals and their families.”

2          In the course of investigations, officers suspected that the 33-year-old female may have a baby as there were messages in her cell phone that made references to a baby.  The female suspect denied this initially but later revealed that she was the caregiver of a one-year old male toddler, who was believed to be with two other suspected drug traffickers. 
 
3          Concerned about the well-being and the safety of the toddler, CNB and the Singapore Police Force mounted a follow-up operation to locate the two other suspected drug traffickers and the toddler.  Swift follow-up operations then led to the arrest of the two other suspected drug traffickers on 27 February.  The first, a 51-year-old male suspected drug trafficker, was arrested in the vicinity of Joo Chiat Road.  Before his arrest, the 51-year-old male was spotted with the toddler.  With the toddler’s safety in mind, CNB officers moved in swiftly to secure him safely, while concurrently taking down the male suspected drug trafficker. 
 
4          Subsequently, a 38-year-old female suspected drug trafficker and another 41-year-old female suspected drug abuser were arrested within a hotel room in the same vicinity.  A total of about 640g of heroin were recovered from within the room.

5          Subsequent investigations led to the arrest of a 34-year-old male who had booked the hotel room.  He was arrested at his residence in Rivervale Drive and is being investigated for drug trafficking offences. 
 
6           All the suspects arrested are Singaporeans.  The toddler has since been handed over to the care of the Child Protective Service of the Ministry of Social and Family Development.  Efforts are currently underway to locate the biological mother of the toddler, who is also wanted for drug offences. 
 
 
7             Mr Sng Chern Hong, Director, Communications Division, CNB, said: “This case clearly highlights the adverse consequences of drugs. The toddler was abandoned by his biological mother and left in the care of a suspected drug trafficker. It was fortunate that our officers were successful in locating the toddler and prevented further harm from being caused to him.”

The regional and global drug situations remain challenging. Drug syndicates continue to profit from ensnaring people into the vicious drug cycle. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported that global seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants had doubled in the period from 2010 to 2015.

          In the early morning of 4 January 2018, CNB officers raided a hotel room located along Geylang Road where a 63-year-old Singaporean and his spouse – a 49-year-old foreign national – were staying. A search of the room uncovered a container with about 250g of vegetable matter believed to be tobacco stained with new psychoactive substance, a bottle of rubbing alcohol, numerous tobacco labels, one weighing scale, rolling papers and a printer.
          Preliminary investigations revealed that the male suspect would adulterate the tobacco stained with NPS, with other substances including thinner and contact cement. He would then repack them into plastic packets and disguise them as normal tobacco for sale.
          Investigations into the drug activities of the suspect are ongoing. The Bureau would like to remind members of the public that abuse of new psychoactive substances can cause harm to one’s mental and physical health. The chemical compounds added to the drugs are unknown, and could cause serious health problems such as severe intoxication, seizures, renal failure and even death. In this case, products such as thinner and contact cement often carry labels warning about possible poisoning from its ingestion, inhalation or consumption.

2         Following the listing of the 24 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.
 
3         CNB will be listing six NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex B). This allows CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.
 
Global NPS Situation
 
4     There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in June 2019 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 892 NPS identified by end 2018.[2]
 


5           Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB regularly reviews strategies to improve detection and regulation of NPS, including regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are currently controlled under the MDA.

[1] New psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances which produce the same (or similar) effects as controlled drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, “ecstasy”, methamphetamine or heroin.


[2] UNODC World Drug Report (June 2019). 





Reference: 
The Fifth Schedule of the MDA was first enacted on 1 May 2013 to allow CNB to control and prevent the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. The Fifth Schedule enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. These processes are necessary before a substance is classified as a controlled drug. The trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of any substance, which is temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule, will not constitute an offence under the MDA, until that substance is listed as a controlled drug in the First Schedule.

Drug traffickers arrested at Tanjong Pagar & Upper Boon Keng

2          In the evening of 16 May, CNB received information on an impending drug transaction in the vicinity of Tanjong Pagar. CNB officers who were deployed in the area spotted two suspected drug traffickers met up and parted ways shortly after.  The first suspect, a 38-year-old, returned to his residence in the same vicinity, and the other suspect, a 44-year-old, departed the vicinity in a taxi.  A team of CNB officers arrested the 44-year-old when the taxi came to a stop along Victoria Street.  About 32g of ‘Ice’ and an improvised drug-smoking apparatus were recovered from the suspect.  A separate team of officers raided the residence of the 38-year-old suspect and arrested the man within the unit.  About 7g of ‘Ice and some drug-taking utensils were recovered from the suspect.  The 38-year-old was then escorted to the lift lobby on the 16th floor of the block, where officers recovered about 5g of cannabis and four fragmented ‘Ecstasy’ tablets from the dry riser in the suspect’s presence.  A 39-year-old suspected drug abuser was also arrested in the vicinity of the block.

Listing of one substance in the First Schedule of the MDA
 
         With effect from 1 May 2019, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing all five New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] currently in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), in the First Schedule of the same Act. This means that these five substances will be reclassified as Class A controlled drugs (see Annex A for the list of drugs). In addition, one substance, lisdexamphetamine, will be listed in the First Schedule as a Class A controlled drug (see Annex B).
 
2.          Following the listing of the substances as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Any person found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject abusers of these substances to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.
 
3.         Their listing in the First Schedule will allow CNB to take decisive action against the abuse and trafficking of such substances.
 
Listing of two NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA
 
4.          CNB will be listing two NPS in the Fifth Schedule of the MDA (see Annex C) with effect from 1 May 2019. This allows CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. 
 
Global NPS Situation
 
5.          There has been a rapid increase in the number, type and availability of NPS across the world. Based on a report released in March 2019 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 899 NPS reported from 2008 to March 2019[2]. Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB monitors the emergence of NPS on the global drug scene and will take steps to control newly-emerged NPS under the MDA.

Reference: 
 
The Fifth Schedule of the MDA was first enacted on 1 May 2013 to allow CNB to control and prevent the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. The trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of any substance, which is temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule, will not constitute an offence under the MDA, until that substance is listed as a controlled drug in the First Schedule. However, the Fifth Schedule enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. These processes are necessary before a substance is classified as a controlled drug.

             In the late hours of 16 April 2019, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested a 38-year-old Singaporean male suspected drug trafficker in the vicinity of Woodlands Street 13.  The suspect resisted arrest violently and necessary force was effected to place him under arrest.  Prior to the arrest, the suspect discarded a sling bag, which was recovered and found to contain two bundles of “Ice’ weighing a total of about 276g.  Under escort by CNB officers, the residential unit of the suspect, located at Teck Whye Avenue, was also raided.  From within the unit, 80 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, three Erimin-5 tablets and about two grammes of ‘Ice’ were recovered. 2          Another party of CNB officers arrested the second suspect, a 31-year-old Malaysian male, at the Woodlands Checkpoint and cash of S$5,100 was recovered from the suspect.  Prior to his arrest, this male Malaysian was believed to have met up with the 38-year-old Singaporean male in the vicinity of Woodlands.

413,Overview of Singapore’s Drug Situation in 2018,2019-02-25,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/overview-of-singapore-s-drug-situation-in-2018," Singapore’s comprehensive approach to tackling both drug supply and demand has enabled us to remain relatively drug-free.
However, we face challenges on the international, regional and local fronts. In particular, the production and trafficking of methamphetamine have increased to alarming levels, while the New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) market continues to evolve. There is also a push in some countries for alternative, liberal drug policies.
There are two key areas of concern on the local drug situation – (i) 40% of drug abusers arrested in 2018 were new abusers, and the proportion of new drug abusers below 30 years of age remained high at 64% in 2018; (ii) there was an 11% year-on-year increase in drug abusers arrested in 2018, primarily NPS and methamphetamine abusers.
Against this challenging backdrop, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) remains steadfast and committed in the fight against drugs. To keep the drug situation under control, CNB maintained a high level of enforcement intensity in 2018 and worked closely with the other Home Team agencies and our strategic partners to conduct close to 1,600 operations targeting drug traffickers and abusers, as well as intercepting drugs at the checkpoints and disrupting the supply inland. 26 drug syndicates were dismantled.
Beyond enforcement, CNB works closely with the community and our partners under the United Against Drugs Coalition and our Anti-Drug Advocates to ensure that Preventive Drug Education remains our first line of defence for a Drug Free Singapore. The community is also encouraged to take a fervent stance against drug abuse and actively spread the anti-drug message.
On a legislative front, we continuously review our approach to ensure that it keeps pace with the evolving drug landscape. For example, amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act have been made in January 2019 to strengthen our enforcement powers, and also enhance the rehabilitation regime.

         In a joint operation mounted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on 3 September 2020, 2 Singaporean males, aged 28 and 43, were arrested for suspected drug activities. A total of about 1,302g of ‘Ice’, about 56g of heroin, 1,000 Erimin-5 tablets and 7 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets were seized during the operation, along with cash amounting to $15,830 and a number of offensive weapons. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth about to $410,000.

2.      In the evening of 3 September, CNB and SPF officers raided a residential unit in the vicinity of Geylang Lorong 27, and forced entry was effected as the man refused to heed the lawful orders of the officers to open the door. As officers moved in to arrest the two males, both put up a violent struggle and necessary force was used to subdue them.

3.      A search was conducted and a bundle containing about 1,103g of ‘Ice’, 29 packets containing about 199g of ‘Ice’ in total, about 56g of heroin, 1,000 Erimin-5 tablets and 7 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets were recovered from the unit, along with numerous drug paraphernalia. Weapons including a parang knife, a baseball bat and a ‘Karambit’ knife were also found, along with cash amounting to $15,830.

435,Amendments To The First Schedule To The Misuse Of Drugs Act (MDA),2020-09-03,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/amendments-to-the-first-schedule-to-the-misuse-of-drugs-act-(mda)," Global NPS Situation
        The global NPS situation remains challenging. Based on a report released in January 2020 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 950 New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] reported from 2008 to January 2020[2]. The increase in the number, types and availability can be attributed to the ease in which new variants are produced simply by introducing slight modifications to the chemical structures of existing NPS. 
2.     Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. 
3.     The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) regularly reviews its strategies to improve the detection and regulation of NPS. This includes the regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are already currently controlled under the the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).
4.     CNB first introduced the generic listing approach to deal with NPS in 2013. Since then, we have noted the increasing number of new variants entering the drug market, especially Synthetic Cannabis. These new variants are designed to evade control and have chemical structures which lie outside our current generic groups. To address these challenges, a comprehensive review was undertaken to study how our coverage against NPS can be strengthened. These changes are as follows: 

a) Three new synthetic cannabinoid generic groups at new paragraphs 20, 21 and 22 of the First Schedule will be introduced, and four existing synthetic cannabinoid generic groups (at paragraphs 8, 12, 14 and 15) and 86 individually listed Synthetic Cannabinoids (at paragraph 18) will be subsumed under these new generic groups.
Examples of NPS under each new synthetic cannabinoid generic groups are found under each description. The list of NPS examples are not exhaustive, and CNB will include new examples as and when the information is available.
b) The introduction of a new generic description to deal with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analogues is also included. The current description at item (78) paragraph 1 of the First Schedule to the MDA does not cover LSD analogues and these must be individually listed for CNB to take action. This is a gap which will be addressed by the new Lysergide generic group. With the change, seven LSD analogues which are individually listed at paragraph 18 of the First Schedule will be delisted and included as examples of LSD analogues under the new Lysergide generic group. 
Changes to Deal with Derivatives   
5.     CNB has observed reports from other countries[3],[4] of authorities seizing substances which were found to be chemically-altered methamphetamine and N,α-Dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy) phenethylamine (MDMA). While there has been no evidence thus far to suggest that these chemically-altered methamphetamine and MDMA have emerged in Singapore, the risk still remains. As a pre-emptive measure, the descriptions for ketamine, methamphetamine and MDMA will be amended to include the derivatives. The amendment will empower CNB to respond decisively to suppress activities involving these chemically-altered controlled drugs, should they become available in Singapore, and to restrict their circulation.

6.     Additionally, the trafficking, manufacturing, importation, exportation, possession or consumption of any substances which are captured in the amended descriptions will constitute an offence under the MDA. Persons found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.


Amendments to the First Schedule to the MDA
7.     In summary, with effect from 4 Sep 2020, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will make the following changes to the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) (see Annex A for the full descriptions):
a) Listing three new synthetic cannabinoid[5] generic groups at paragraphs 20, 21 and 22;

b) Delisting four existing synthetic cannabinoid generic groups at paragraphs 8, 12, 14 and 15;
c) Delisting 93[6] existing individually listed new psychoactive substances (NPS) at paragraph 18;

d) Amending item (46) at paragraph 1 to include derivatives of N,α-Dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenethylamine (MDMA);

e) Amending item (71) at paragraph 1 to include derivatives of ketamine;
f) Amending item (78) at paragraph 1 to expand the generic description to deal with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analogues; and
g) Amending item (83) at paragraph 1 to include derivatives of methamphetamine.
8.     With the above revisions, the MDA will contain 12 generic groups[7] and 67 individually named NPS (at paragraph 18). These amendments enhance CNB’s existing generic listing approach to control the proliferation of NPS, as well as enable CNB to take decisive action against the abuse and trafficking of a wider range of new, synthesised substances.

            With effect from 1 May 2020, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing 17 New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)[1] in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) (see Annex A for the list of drugs).
 
2.             Following the listing of the 17 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Persons found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject NPS abusers to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.
 
3.             Their listing in the First Schedule will allow CNB to take decisive action against the abuse and trafficking of such substances.
 
Listing of three NPS in the Fifth Schedule to the MDA
 
4.             CNB will be listing three NPS in the Fifth Schedule to the MDA (see Annex B) with effect from 1 May 2020. This allows CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted.


 

[1] New psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances which produce the same (or similar) effects as controlled drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, “ecstasy”, methamphetamine or heroin.

Global NPS Situation
 
2.             There has been a rapid increase in the number, types and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in January 2020 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 950 NPS reported from 2008 to January 2020[1].
 
3.             Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit medical use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB regularly reviews its strategies to improve the detection and regulation of NPS, including the regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are currently controlled under the MDA.

Reference:
 
The Fifth Schedule of the MDA was first enacted on 1 May 2013 to allow CNB to control and prevent the proliferation of NPS. NPS can be temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule for up to 12 months, with a possibility of extension for another 12 months. The Fifth Schedule enables CNB to seize these NPS so that their circulation can be restricted while research and industry consultation are conducted. These processes are necessary before a substance is classified as a controlled drug. The trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of any substance, which is temporarily listed in the Fifth Schedule, will not constitute an offence under the MDA, until that substance is listed as a controlled drug in the First Schedule.

462,Overview of Singapore’s Drug Situation in 2019,2020-02-06,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/overview-of-singapore-s-drug-situation-in-2019," Singapore’s comprehensive approach to tackling both drug supply and demand has allowed us to keep the drug situation under control, in spite of the challenging global and regional drug situation. This approach continues to receive strong public support, based on the Public Perception Survey on Singapore Anti-Drug Policies conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in 2018, where almost nine in 10 Singaporeans agreed that our drug laws are effective.
Regional developments, such as the increase in methamphetamine supply, can have adverse downstream implications on our drug situation. Globally, the new psychoactive substances (NPS) market continues to evolve and expand quickly. The push for drug liberalisation in some countries is a cause for concern. We must also not underestimate the impact of social media and mass media in spreading misinformation that normalises drug use, especially among our young.
Against this backdrop, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) remains steadfast in its mission for a drug-free Singapore. To this end, CNB conducted intensive enforcement operations in 2019, dismantling 28 drug syndicates. Working closely with other Home Team agencies, CNB also worked closely with other Home Team agencies, conducting around 1,400 operations across Singapore, including at our land, air and sea checkpoints to intercept drugs entering Singapore.
Our drug situation last year presented several concerns. The proportion of new drug abusers arrested remained high at 41%. The proportion of new drug abusers arrested under 30 years old remained significant at 62%. While there was a decrease in the number of heroin abusers arrested, there was an increase in those arrested for NPS and methamphetamine abuse.
Beyond enforcement, CNB continues to enhance preventive drug education (PDE) efforts as the first line of defence against drugs. In 2019, we used Augmented Reality technology to reach out to young people. We also ramped up outreach initiatives on social media and through schools, parents and our Anti-Drug Advocates.  There were also concerted efforts to expand PDE outreach within the Indian community. Following the “Dadah Itu Haram” (DIH) campaign which has seen strong support from the Malay-Muslim community, the “Bothaiporulai Ethirthu Nirpom” (BEN) (or ‘We Stand United Against Drugs’) campaign was launched.
CNB continually reviews our anti-drug strategy to stay ahead of the evolving drug landscape. For example, on the legislative front, 31 new NPS were listed as Class A controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2019 to strengthen our enforcement efforts.
In Singapore, the fight against the scourge of drugs combines preventive drug education, tough laws and effective enforcement, strategic international engagement and evidence-based treatment and rehabilitation. The community can be a strong ally in this fight by spreading the anti-drug message to their own circles of influence. Together, we can keep our homes, streets and communities drug-free for our future generations.

469,No Safe Haven: 50 Suspected Drug Offenders Arrested in Island-wide Operation Targeted at Drug Transactions Conducted on Chat Applications,2021-12-01,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/no-safe-haven-50-suspected-drug-offenders-arrested-in-island-wide-operation-targeted-at-drug-transactions-conducted-on-chat-applications," A total of 50 suspected drug offenders were arrested in an island-wide operation conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in four different phases from 16 to 30 November 2021. In this island-wide operation that was targeted at drug transactions conducted on encrypted chat applications, a total of about 55g of ‘Ice’, 395g of cannabis, 48g of ketamine, 44 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 14 LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) stamps, 25g of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), 15 Erimin-5 tablets and three bottles of liquid suspected to contain GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) were seized. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth close to $20,400.

2.         Some of the areas covered during this island-wide operation include Ang Mo Kio, Boon Lay, Hougang, Pasir Ris and Punggol.

18 November 2021: Arrests of two subjects in the vicinity of Punggol Way and Sengkang East Way

3.         In the evening of 18 November 2021, during one of the phases of the island-wide operation, CNB officers intercepted a vehicle in the vicinity of Punggol Way, and arrested a 20-year-old Singaporean male. 21 packets containing a total of about 16g of ‘Ice’, 247g of cannabis, 9g of ketamine, 30 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, six LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) stamps and one Erimin-5 tablet were recovered from the 20-year-old male.

4.         In a follow-up operation conducted in the same evening, a separate party of CNB officers arrested a 35-year-old Singaporean male in the vicinity of Sengkang East Way. A search was conducted, and a packet containing about 25g of cannabis was recovered from the 35-year-old male. The 35-year-old male was also escorted to a residential unit in the same vicinity, where drug paraphernalia were seized.

5.        CNB is aware that criminals, including drug trafficking syndicates, have been utilising encrypted chat applications such as Telegram for their illegal activities. CNB monitors such developments carefully, and has been taking regular enforcement actions against offenders who utilise such platforms for their drug activities.



6.         Superintendent Aaron Tang, Director of Intelligence Division, said:


“Drug offenders have always been trying to evade enforcement efforts. Syndicates will use novel concealment methods to smuggle drugs into Singapore; traffickers will employ evasive tactics to avoid CNB’s surveillance efforts; abusers will leverage secured messaging applications to look for drugs. CNB monitors such developments and is on a constant lookout for emerging trends and platforms.
Given the popularity of messaging applications for daily communications, it is no surprise that drug syndicates and drug pushers are lulled into a false sense of security in using them for their drug activities. These offenders may think that such applications can offer them a certain level of anonymity to allow them to carry out their illegal activities, and they can avoid CNB’s surveillance. But they cannot be more wrong.
There have been reports recently on how criminals are using Telegram for their illegal activities. But this is not a new phenomenon. As early as 2019, CNB has been aware and has been taking regular enforcement actions against drug offenders who use the Telegram platform for their activities. In fact, more than 200 drug offenders who had conducted drug transactions on the Telegram platform have been arrested, and CNB has seized more than 14 kg of ‘Ice’, 7.6 kg of cannabis, 400g of heroin and an assortment of other drugs which had been transacted through Telegram.
We know their modus operandi, and will continue to be tenacious in following up on all such leads by carefully gathering intelligence and launching well-timed operations to take these offenders out.

Regardless of the platform or tactics used in an attempt to evade detection, there is no safe haven for drug offenders in Singapore.”
7.         Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing.

He passed away on 16 September 2021 after falling from height on the same day.

Background

2.     CNB issued a statement on 13 October 2021 in response to media queries, after Justin’s mother, Ms Cecilia Ow, published her letter of appeal (dated 1 October 2021) to Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam. CNB had stated that once investigations were completed, the findings would be shared with Ms Cecilia Ow.

3.     The Singapore Police Force (SPF) also commenced investigations into Justin’s death following his fall from height on 16 September 2021. An autopsy was conducted and the cause of death was determined to be multiple injuries consistent with being sustained from a fall from height. Toxicology tests were conducted and the report indicated that there were traces of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), a Class A controlled drug listed under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and Nitrazepam detected in his urine and blood. These results and findings will be submitted at the Coroner’s Inquiry.

Objectives of CNB's Internal Investigations

4.     CNB’s internal investigations were initiated to establish the facts relating to Justin’s arrest and the subsequent investigations against him, up to the point of CNB’s last contact with him on 23 June 2021.

5.     Justin fell from a height, some 12 weeks after his release on Court bail, on 16 September 2021. CNB’s internal investigations are separate from the investigations undertaken by the SPF in relation to his fall from height on 16 September 2021.

Findings of CNB's Internal Investigations: Facts Established

Arrest of Justin on 3 February 2021

6.     In January 2021, CNB conducted investigations into a subject who was suspected of trafficking LSD stamps (see footnote 1). He was openly advertising them for sale on a messaging app. CNB officers conducted two successful test buys to verify the information, and arrested the subject, later ascertained to be Justin, at about 7.25pm on 3 February 2021. The arrest took place at Serangoon North Ave 4. In a follow-up operation on 4 February 2021 at about 11.42am, 131 LSD stamps were seized from another location in the vicinity of Serangoon North Ave 4. Investigations found that the 131 LSD stamps belonged to Justin. He admitted that they were meant for sale, including to friends. He admitted that he himself had also abused LSD stamps.

No physical force nor abrasive language were used

7.     When he was arrested on 3 February 2021, Justin was compliant and did not put up any struggle. The officers held on to him while he was handcuffed, and escorted to various locations in the course of investigations. This is a standard operating procedure in order to prevent escape or self-harm. There was no unreasonable use of force on him.

8.     Following his arrest, nine CNB officers were deployed for a follow-up anti-drug operation on the same day at Justin’s place of residence located in the vicinity of Hougang Street 22. The number of officers deployed takes into account various factors. There is a need for operational flexibility in the event that there were more suspects and arrests to be made, or if any follow-up operations needed to be immediately conducted. Six of the nine officers entered the unit – upon being granted permission by Ms Cecilia Ow who was present. Out of the six officers, one senior officer leading the team and one female officer engaged Ms Cecilia Ow, while the remaining four escorted Justin into his bedroom. Two officers remained next to Justin, while the other two conducted a search of the room. The search took place from about 9.02pm to about 9.20pm. Justin was escorted to the CNB Enforcement Office at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters following the search.

9.     Arrested persons under investigations are not allowed to speak to their next-of-kin (NOK) on the details of the case, but are allowed to converse on general matters. In this case, Justin spoke with Ms Cecilia Ow after the search. Further, as he could not locate his eczema medication, Ms Cecilia Ow was also present when he was looking for his eczema medication in his room with the help of CNB officers.

10.     Justin was subsequently transferred to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters, and was referred to a lock-up medical doctor for examination on 4 February 2021. The subsequent medical report issued noted that Justin had a slight abrasion over his left foot and a past history of eczema. The medical report concluded that Justin was well and that “the physical examination was unremarkable”. When Justin was released from the lock-up, he signed to acknowledge that he had no complaints. Justin was not mistreated in any way.

No undue delay in investigations or release from custody

11.     Justin’s case was investigated within a reasonable period, and he was released from custody without delay. As the duration of interviews and serving of charges varies from case to case, it is not possible to provide an estimate to NOKs on the duration required. For security reasons, arrested persons are also not permitted to retain their personal belongings (including mobile devices) when they are admitted into the lock-up. This is to prevent unauthorised communication with others which may jeopardise the investigation, escape by the arrested subject, or injury to self or others. 

12.     For young suspects under investigations (which are not capital cases), CNB ensures that they are released on bail as soon as possible. In this case, Justin was arrested on 3 February 2021 at about 7.25pm, and following initial investigation, he was escorted for a house search that took place from about 9.02pm to about 9.20pm. He was then escorted to the CNB Enforcement Office at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for a urine test, recording of further statement, and detailed searches and documentation of personal properties. He was subsequently escorted to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters where he was admitted to the lock-up at about 1.27am on 4 February 2021. Given the time of admission, Justin was allowed to rest before the first video-recorded interview was conducted at about 11.45am the same day. As the 131 LSD stamps were only recovered at about 11.42am, a second video-recorded interview was conducted from about 7.34pm to 8.02pm, during which he admitted ownership of the drugs found and that the drugs were meant for sale. After the second video-recorded interview, Justin was allowed to make a call to Ms Cecilia Ow at about 8.53pm, and was released on bail to her at about 10.41pm on 4 February 2021.

13.     In the subsequent months, the CNB Investigating Officer (IO) continued with his investigations, retrieving various reports, including the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) analysis of the drug exhibits, medical reports, and POLCam footage showing Justin in possession of a bag containing the 131 LSD stamps prior to his arrest. Upon completion of investigations in May 2021, CNB consulted the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC), which directed in June 2021 that Justin be charged for drug trafficking offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. He was asked to report to CNB Headquarters on 23 June 2021.

14.     When Justin reported to CNB Headquarters on 23 June 2021 at about 12.40pm, he was admitted into the lock-up, and served with the drug trafficking charges. This process was video-recorded. As drug-related offences, especially drug trafficking, attract heavy penalties and there is a high flight risk, subjects charged with drug-related offences will normally not be released on bail, and will instead be escorted to Court for prosecution the next day. However, in view of his age, CNB released Justin on bail after serving the charges on him, and allowed him to report to Court the next day. Justin was released on the same day at about 7.52pm to Ms Cecilia Ow. When Justin was released from custody of the lock-up, he signed to acknowledge that he had no complaints. This was the last contact that CNB had with him. He was subsequently charged in Court on 24 June 2021 and released on Court bail.

15.     Regarding the allegations that the Court had postponed the case a few times which added more stress to Justin, the Prosecution was ready to take the plea on 24 June 2021 when Justin was charged in Court. It was the Defence Counsel representing Justin who had requested to adjourn the court mentions four times, first from 24 June 2021 to 22 July 2021, and then to 19 August 2021, 9 September 2021 and finally to 23 September 2021.

Appropriate Adult (AA) scheme used for suspects below 16 years old

16.      The Appropriate Adult (AA) Scheme is used for suspects below 16 years old who are interviewed by the SPF or CNB during criminal investigations.

17.     Justin was 17 years old at the time of arrest. During the first video-recorded interview on 4 February 2021, Justin mentioned to the CNB IO that he was having depression and had previously been diagnosed by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for the same. CNB proceeded with both the first and second video-recorded interviews on 4 February 2021, taking into consideration the following factors: He was composed and coherent during the interviews, and was able to logically articulate the flow of events, including sharing about his research on drugs and his trafficking modus operandi. He sought clarifications when he wanted to make amendments. He was observed not to show signs of distress during the interviews.

18.     The CNB IO also applied for a medical report from IMH. The IMH report stated that Justin was referred in 2020 by the school-based REACH community team for low mood and suicidality. The report also stated that he was diagnosed with Dysthymia (a form of depression) and had been seeing a psychologist regularly.

19.     Throughout their interactions with Justin, CNB officers exercised sensitivity and endeavoured to release him on bail as soon as possible. No physical force, nor any abrasive language, were used at any time while he was in CNB’s custody. 

20.     Justin was referred to medical doctors due to his own declaration of “eczema, mild depression” and “eczema, minor depression” in the ‘Person-in-Custody Medical State Form’ on 4 February and 23 June 2021 respectively. In the subsequent medical reports issued and email clarifications with the doctors, there were no allegations of assault. The medical report for the medical examination on 23 June 2021 conducted after the serving of charges also stated that “(t)he patient was stable with no acute issues at the time of consultation. The patient was not experiencing any hallucinations. He did not have any self-harm or suicidal thoughts and did not report feeling unwell.”

No mistreatment during time in custody

21.     Internal investigations showed no mistreatment during the time that Justin was in the lock-up. CCTV footage showed that that he was issued with a blanket. He was given his meals, including drinks, during his custody in the lock-up in February and June 2021. During the admission process, he was also informed of his rights to request for these items if he wanted to. CCTV footage also showed that on 4 February 2021, he was seen doing some stretching and was in a planking position for about 1 minute and 20 seconds while he was in the lock-up. He was not stopped by officers manning the lockup since he was not causing any disturbance. He was also observed to have walked around the cell and chatted with other persons-in-custody at different periods. CCTV footage also showed that on 23 June 2021, there were no instances of him trying to do push-ups, nor were there any restrictions imposed on him from moving about in the cell. This is contrary to allegations that he was not allowed to do push-ups to keep himself warm.

22.     Based on interviews with officers involved in the arrest and those who had contact with him during custody in February and June 2021, Justin was not denied water during his time in custody. In fact, all drug suspects are given ample access to water in order to be able to provide their urine specimen for drug tests to be conducted. This is contrary to the allegation that he was denied water.

Belongings typically returned only at the end of court process

23.     Belongings seized for the purpose of investigations are typically returned only at the end of the court process as they might be required as evidence for the offences.

Engagement with Ms Cecilia Ow

24.     Following Ms Cecilia Ow’s letter dated 1 October 2021 to Minister K Shanmugam, the Minister contacted her personally on the same day to assure her that a thorough review into Justin’s arrest and investigations would be conducted. CNB has been engaging Ms Cecilia Ow since 20 September 2021. The senior officer-in-charge of the investigation team had returned her call on the same day. The Deputy Director of CNB had also contacted her on 21 September 2021. CNB assured her that there would be full internal investigations. On 30 September and 8 October 2021, a CNB senior official had also met Ms Cecilia Ow at her residence and at the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters respectively. During these meetings, Ms Cecilia Ow was advised about the investigations. Justin’s properties were returned to her. She was offered psychological support on 21 September 2021 (para 26 below). During the meeting on 8 October 2021, she was provided with a timeframe of about 2 weeks for CNB to complete internal investigations, and was informed that CNB would share the findings with her once investigations are completed.

25.     The findings of CNB’s internal investigations were shared with her on 22 October 2021.

Psychological support offered

26.     CNB had arranged for psychological support to be provided to Ms Cecilia Ow during this difficult period which she consented to on 21 September 2021, and a CNB psychologist spoke to her on 22 September 2021 for an hour to provide support and share coping strategies (Ms Cecilia Ow had said in an online post of 18 October that she did not accept CNB’s offer to provide psychological support to her). On 30 September 2021, when the CNB senior official met Ms Cecilia Ow at her residence, the psychologist was also present to check on her. However, a family member conveyed later on the same day on her behalf that she did not wish to take up further psychological support from CNB.

Summary of findings from CNB's internal investigation 

27.     Based on the investigation findings, Justin was treated professionally and fairly. He was coherent and articulate in his responses throughout the video-recorded interviews. Justin was subjected to medical examinations on 4 February and 23 June 2021 at the lock-up and on both occasions, the medical doctors did not detect any issues of concern. CNB’s internal investigations also showed that there was no undue delay in the investigation and prosecutorial processes.

28.     CNB understands that this is a difficult time for Ms Cecilia Ow and will continue to render assistance to her. 

29.     CNB is committed to keeping the streets of Singapore drug-free, and conducts rigorous enforcement to deal with the trafficking of drugs. CNB has to adopt a proactive approach to disrupt such activities before they take root. Drug trafficking and drug abuse are serious threats to our society. If left unchecked, more lives would be harmed and families affected.

Footnote 1

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Class A drugs are considered to be the most harmful. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, those convicted of trafficking in LSD will be liable for a minimum punishment of 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane. 

LSD is often sold on blotting paper, which is usually imprinted with a colourful cartoon or design and comes in square cuts of less than 1 cm each. Although abusers take it orally, the tabs of blotting paper can also be placed on skin areas that readily absorb the drug into the bloodstream, for example, under the eyelid. When ingested, LSD takes effect within 30 minutes. Its effects are strongest after 3 to 5 hours and can last up to 12 hours. Each square-cut paper (or ‘stamp’) laced with LSD would be considered 1 dose. 

The long-term effects of LSD abuse include psychosis, violent mood changes, hallucinations and paranoia. Other effects include mood and personality changes (sometimes extreme), dissociation (referred to as “trips”), anxiety, depression, long lasting psychoses (e.g. severe depression), schizophrenia, involuntary “flash-backs”, and Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorders (HPPD) i.e. hallucinations and flashbacks that persist for days after the LSD abuse. If consumed in a sufficiently large dose, LSD produces delusions and visual hallucinations that distort the user’s sense of time and identity.


      This statement summarises CNB’s findings relating to its investigations against Justin Lee (Justin), for suspected drug trafficking, up to the point of CNB’s last contact with him on 23 June 2021. He passed away on 16 September 2021 after falling from height on the same day.

Background

2.     CNB issued a statement on 13 October 2021 in response to media queries, after Justin’s mother, Ms Cecilia Ow, published her letter of appeal (dated 1 October 2021) to Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam. CNB had stated that once investigations were completed, the findings would be shared with Ms Cecilia Ow.

3.     The Singapore Police Force (SPF) also commenced investigations into Justin’s death following his fall from height on 16 September 2021. An autopsy was conducted and the cause of death was determined to be multiple injuries consistent with being sustained from a fall from height. Toxicology tests were conducted and the report indicated that there were traces of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), a Class A controlled drug listed under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and Nitrazepam detected in his urine and blood. These results and findings will be submitted at the Coroner’s Inquiry.

Objectives of CNB's Internal Investigations

4.     CNB’s internal investigations were initiated to establish the facts relating to Justin’s arrest and the subsequent investigations against him, up to the point of CNB’s last contact with him on 23 June 2021.

5.     Justin fell from a height, some 12 weeks after his release on Court bail, on 16 September 2021. CNB’s internal investigations are separate from the investigations undertaken by the SPF in relation to his fall from height on 16 September 2021.

Findings of CNB's Internal Investigations: Facts Established

Arrest of Justin on 3 February 2021

6.     In January 2021, CNB conducted investigations into a subject who was suspected of trafficking LSD stamps (see footnote 1). He was openly advertising them for sale on a messaging app. CNB officers conducted two successful test buys to verify the information, and arrested the subject, later ascertained to be Justin, at about 7.25pm on 3 February 2021. The arrest took place at Serangoon North Ave 4. In a follow-up operation on 4 February 2021 at about 11.42am, 131 LSD stamps were seized from another location in the vicinity of Serangoon North Ave 4. Investigations found that the 131 LSD stamps belonged to Justin. He admitted that they were meant for sale, including to friends. He admitted that he himself had also abused LSD stamps.

No physical force nor abrasive language were used

7.     When he was arrested on 3 February 2021, Justin was compliant and did not put up any struggle. The officers held on to him while he was handcuffed, and escorted to various locations in the course of investigations. This is a standard operating procedure in order to prevent escape or self-harm. There was no unreasonable use of force on him.

8.     Following his arrest, nine CNB officers were deployed for a follow-up anti-drug operation on the same day at Justin’s place of residence located in the vicinity of Hougang Street 22. The number of officers deployed takes into account various factors. There is a need for operational flexibility in the event that there were more suspects and arrests to be made, or if any follow-up operations needed to be immediately conducted. Six of the nine officers entered the unit – upon being granted permission by Ms Cecilia Ow who was present. Out of the six officers, one senior officer leading the team and one female officer engaged Ms Cecilia Ow, while the remaining four escorted Justin into his bedroom. Two officers remained next to Justin, while the other two conducted a search of the room. The search took place from about 9.02pm to about 9.20pm. Justin was escorted to the CNB Enforcement Office at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters following the search.

9.     Arrested persons under investigations are not allowed to speak to their next-of-kin (NOK) on the details of the case, but are allowed to converse on general matters. In this case, Justin spoke with Ms Cecilia Ow after the search. Further, as he could not locate his eczema medication, Ms Cecilia Ow was also present when he was looking for his eczema medication in his room with the help of CNB officers.

10.     Justin was subsequently transferred to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters, and was referred to a lock-up medical doctor for examination on 4 February 2021. The subsequent medical report issued noted that Justin had a slight abrasion over his left foot and a past history of eczema. The medical report concluded that Justin was well and that “the physical examination was unremarkable”. When Justin was released from the lock-up, he signed to acknowledge that he had no complaints. Justin was not mistreated in any way.

No undue delay in investigations or release from custody

11.     Justin’s case was investigated within a reasonable period, and he was released from custody without delay. As the duration of interviews and serving of charges varies from case to case, it is not possible to provide an estimate to NOKs on the duration required. For security reasons, arrested persons are also not permitted to retain their personal belongings (including mobile devices) when they are admitted into the lock-up. This is to prevent unauthorised communication with others which may jeopardise the investigation, escape by the arrested subject, or injury to self or others. 

12.     For young suspects under investigations (which are not capital cases), CNB ensures that they are released on bail as soon as possible. In this case, Justin was arrested on 3 February 2021 at about 7.25pm, and following initial investigation, he was escorted for a house search that took place from about 9.02pm to about 9.20pm. He was then escorted to the CNB Enforcement Office at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for a urine test, recording of further statement, and detailed searches and documentation of personal properties. He was subsequently escorted to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters where he was admitted to the lock-up at about 1.27am on 4 February 2021. Given the time of admission, Justin was allowed to rest before the first video-recorded interview was conducted at about 11.45am the same day. As the 131 LSD stamps were only recovered at about 11.42am, a second video-recorded interview was conducted from about 7.34pm to 8.02pm, during which he admitted ownership of the drugs found and that the drugs were meant for sale. After the second video-recorded interview, Justin was allowed to make a call to Ms Cecilia Ow at about 8.53pm, and was released on bail to her at about 10.41pm on 4 February 2021.

13.     In the subsequent months, the CNB Investigating Officer (IO) continued with his investigations, retrieving various reports, including the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) analysis of the drug exhibits, medical reports, and POLCam footage showing Justin in possession of a bag containing the 131 LSD stamps prior to his arrest. Upon completion of investigations in May 2021, CNB consulted the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC), which directed in June 2021 that Justin be charged for drug trafficking offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. He was asked to report to CNB Headquarters on 23 June 2021.

14.     When Justin reported to CNB Headquarters on 23 June 2021 at about 12.40pm, he was admitted into the lock-up, and served with the drug trafficking charges. This process was video-recorded. As drug-related offences, especially drug trafficking, attract heavy penalties and there is a high flight risk, subjects charged with drug-related offences will normally not be released on bail, and will instead be escorted to Court for prosecution the next day. However, in view of his age, CNB released Justin on bail after serving the charges on him, and allowed him to report to Court the next day. Justin was released on the same day at about 7.52pm to Ms Cecilia Ow. When Justin was released from custody of the lock-up, he signed to acknowledge that he had no complaints. This was the last contact that CNB had with him. He was subsequently charged in Court on 24 June 2021 and released on Court bail.

15.     Regarding the allegations that the Court had postponed the case a few times which added more stress to Justin, the Prosecution was ready to take the plea on 24 June 2021 when Justin was charged in Court. It was the Defence Counsel representing Justin who had requested to adjourn the court mentions four times, first from 24 June 2021 to 22 July 2021, and then to 19 August 2021, 9 September 2021 and finally to 23 September 2021.

Appropriate Adult (AA) scheme used for suspects below 16 years old

16.      The Appropriate Adult (AA) Scheme is used for suspects below 16 years old who are interviewed by the SPF or CNB during criminal investigations.

17.     Justin was 17 years old at the time of arrest. During the first video-recorded interview on 4 February 2021, Justin mentioned to the CNB IO that he was having depression and had previously been diagnosed by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for the same. CNB proceeded with both the first and second video-recorded interviews on 4 February 2021, taking into consideration the following factors: He was composed and coherent during the interviews, and was able to logically articulate the flow of events, including sharing about his research on drugs and his trafficking modus operandi. He sought clarifications when he wanted to make amendments. He was observed not to show signs of distress during the interviews.

18.     The CNB IO also applied for a medical report from IMH. The IMH report stated that Justin was referred in 2020 by the school-based REACH community team for low mood and suicidality. The report also stated that he was diagnosed with Dysthymia (a form of depression) and had been seeing a psychologist regularly.

19.     Throughout their interactions with Justin, CNB officers exercised sensitivity and endeavoured to release him on bail as soon as possible. No physical force, nor any abrasive language, were used at any time while he was in CNB’s custody. 

20.     Justin was referred to medical doctors due to his own declaration of “eczema, mild depression” and “eczema, minor depression” in the ‘Person-in-Custody Medical State Form’ on 4 February and 23 June 2021 respectively. In the subsequent medical reports issued and email clarifications with the doctors, there were no allegations of assault. The medical report for the medical examination on 23 June 2021 conducted after the serving of charges also stated that “(t)he patient was stable with no acute issues at the time of consultation. The patient was not experiencing any hallucinations. He did not have any self-harm or suicidal thoughts and did not report feeling unwell.”

No mistreatment during time in custody

21.     Internal investigations showed no mistreatment during the time that Justin was in the lock-up. CCTV footage showed that that he was issued with a blanket. He was given his meals, including drinks, during his custody in the lock-up in February and June 2021. During the admission process, he was also informed of his rights to request for these items if he wanted to. CCTV footage also showed that on 4 February 2021, he was seen doing some stretching and was in a planking position for about 1 minute and 20 seconds while he was in the lock-up. He was not stopped by officers manning the lockup since he was not causing any disturbance. He was also observed to have walked around the cell and chatted with other persons-in-custody at different periods. CCTV footage also showed that on 23 June 2021, there were no instances of him trying to do push-ups, nor were there any restrictions imposed on him from moving about in the cell. This is contrary to allegations that he was not allowed to do push-ups to keep himself warm.

22.     Based on interviews with officers involved in the arrest and those who had contact with him during custody in February and June 2021, Justin was not denied water during his time in custody. In fact, all drug suspects are given ample access to water in order to be able to provide their urine specimen for drug tests to be conducted. This is contrary to the allegation that he was denied water.

Belongings typically returned only at the end of court process

23.     Belongings seized for the purpose of investigations are typically returned only at the end of the court process as they might be required as evidence for the offences.

Engagement with Ms Cecilia Ow

24.     Following Ms Cecilia Ow’s letter dated 1 October 2021 to Minister K Shanmugam, the Minister contacted her personally on the same day to assure her that a thorough review into Justin’s arrest and investigations would be conducted. CNB has been engaging Ms Cecilia Ow since 20 September 2021. The senior officer-in-charge of the investigation team had returned her call on the same day.

During the meeting on 8 October 2021, she was provided with a timeframe of about 2 weeks for CNB to complete internal investigations, and was informed that CNB would share the findings with her once investigations are completed.

25.     The findings of CNB’s internal investigations were shared with her on 22 October 2021.

Close to 55kg of controlled drugs with an estimated street value of RM4.9 million were seized in the operations.

Collaboration between CNB and NCID

2.     Since July 2021, CNB has been monitoring a Malaysian-based syndicate that was believed to have been trafficking drugs using Singapore-based freight forwarding companies, as legitimate forwarding agents, to deliver parcels which contain concealed drugs to other countries through Singapore. CNB actively monitored the activities of the syndicate and provided the information to the NCID. Based on information provided by CNB, NCID commenced their investigations. 

Arrests of 5 suspected drug traffickers

3.     Between 24 and 28 September 2021, the NCID conducted a series of operations around Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Kuala Lumpur that resulted in the arrest of five Malaysians aged between 21 and 71, and the seizure of drugs worth RM4.9 million along with various drug processing equipment and 2.2kg of caffeine believed to be used in illicit drug production. Details of drugs seized by the NCID are as follows:




Drug Type 
Seizure 


 Methamphetamine (‘Ice’)
 5.8kg


 Ketamine
 14.8kg


 MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
 34.3 kg (powder) and 30.1 litres



 

4.         Investigations by the NCID into the drug activities of the suspects are ongoing.

5.    “Even as drug trafficking syndicates try to circumvent travel restrictions by using parcels and postage services to traffic drugs, close international cooperation between law enforcement agencies will not be impacted. The swift arrests are testament to the close cooperation between CNB and NCID, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank NCID for their continuous support in securing a drug-free environment for both countries. Both agencies will continue to share intelligence in timely fashion and work closely together against transnational drug trafficking activities. Singapore does not tolerate the activities of syndicates which makes use of Singapore’s connectivity to ship their drugs, and CNB will continue to work closely with our foreign counterparts to interdict the supply of drugs, and to prevent Singapore from being used as a transhipment hub for drugs.” – AC Leon Chan, Deputy Director CNB (Operations).

Collaboration between CNB and NCID

2.     Since July 2021, CNB has been monitoring a Malaysian-based syndicate that was believed to have been trafficking drugs using Singapore-based freight forwarding companies, as legitimate forwarding agents, to deliver parcels which contain concealed drugs to other countries through Singapore. CNB actively monitored the activities of the syndicate and provided the information to the NCID. Based on information provided by CNB, NCID commenced their investigations. 

Arrests of 5 suspected drug traffickers

3.     Between 24 and 28 September 2021, the NCID conducted a series of operations around Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Kuala Lumpur that resulted in the arrest of five Malaysians aged between 21 and 71, and the seizure of drugs worth RM4.9 million along with various drug processing equipment and 2.2kg of caffeine believed to be used in illicit drug production.

4.         Investigations by the NCID into the drug activities of the suspects are ongoing.

5.    “Even as drug trafficking syndicates try to circumvent travel restrictions by using parcels and postage services to traffic drugs, close international cooperation between law enforcement agencies will not be impacted. The swift arrests are testament to the close cooperation between CNB and NCID, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank NCID for their continuous support in securing a drug-free environment for both countries. Both agencies will continue to share intelligence in timely fashion and work closely together against transnational drug trafficking activities. Singapore does not tolerate the activities of syndicates which makes use of Singapore’s connectivity to ship their drugs, and CNB will continue to work closely with our foreign counterparts to interdict the supply of drugs, and to prevent Singapore from being used as a transhipment hub for drugs.” – AC Leon Chan, Deputy Director CNB (Operations).

A total of about 3,159g of cannabis, 14g of ‘Ice’, 9g of cocaine, 79 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, one Erimin-5 tablet, 108 LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) stamps, and 51 baked goods and butter believed to be infused with cannabis were seized from the operation. Cash amounting to $4,100 was also recovered. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $57,000.

2.         In the morning of 22 June, CNB officers raided a residential unit in the vicinity of Siglap Walk and arrested a 30-year-old Singaporean male and 25-year-old Singaporean female therein. A search was conducted in the unit, and a total of about 3,159g of cannabis, 14g of ‘Ice’, 9g of cocaine, 79 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, one Erimin-5 tablet, 108 LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) stamps, and 51 baked goods and butter believed to be infused with cannabis were seized from the same unit, along with cash amounting to $4,100.

4.         CNB is aware that cannabis has been decriminalised or legalised in various jurisdictions around the world, and the sale of cannabis and / or products containing cannabis may be allowed in those countries. Notwithstanding, there is well-founded and strong research that has shown short-term and long-term adverse effects associated with cannabis use, including impairments to one’s respiratory and cognitive functions. These findings corroborate with Singapore’s position that cannabis should remain an illicit drug.

CNB will continue to conduct rigorous, well-timed enforcement operations to neutralise drug activities, and keep the streets of Singapore safe from drugs.

Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, delivered a keynote speech at the virtual event.
2.         This year marks CNB’s 50th anniversary. In his keynote speech, Assoc Prof Faishal expressed his appreciation towards CNB officers for keeping Singapore drug-free and announced that there will be a series of events lined up to commemorate this important milestone. This will include a TV mini-series based on the lives of CNB officers, to give insight into their work and generate greater awareness of the harms of drugs to the individual, family and society.

3.         Assoc Prof Faishal also announced the deployment of a portable Mobile Diary to ground officers that will further strengthen CNB’s drug enforcement efforts. The Mobile Diary will enable officers to perform tasks remotely, such as making instant electronic records of incidents and conducting screening on persons and/or vehicles of interest while on the move. The Mobile Diary will be integrated with CNB’s case management system, Integrated Drug Enforcement Administrative System II (IDEAS II), for better resource optimisation and to streamline information sharing within CNB and with other relevant parties for more effective enforcement capabilities.

4.         Assoc Prof Faishal also emphasised the need to support drug abusers in their rehabilitation to help them lead a drug-free life. Since November 2019, CNB has been piloting the Community Supervision Skills (CoSS) sessions, which aim to better address supervisees’ reintegration needs through structured interviews at supervision sessions to facilitate referrals to the Industrial & Services Co-Operative Society (ISCOS). ISCOS will then channel supervisees to relevant social service agencies for assistance.

5.         Amidst the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, CNB remains committed to realising the vision of a drug-free Singapore. CNB kept up a high operational tempo in 2020, making significant drug seizures and dismantling 24 drug syndicates. In his message delivered at the event, Director CNB, Mr Ng Ser Song, said that drug syndicates would continue to seek inroads into the local drug market, increase their activities and expand their influence even during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and he called upon CNB officers to remain vigilant in their fight against drugs.

6.         Looking ahead, CNB will continue to adopt a comprehensive approach to drug control by intensifying preventive drug education efforts, keeping our laws relevant, strengthening enforcement and supervision, and sustaining engagement with community and international partners. These include working with youths and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to produce targeted anti-drug messaging and promote a drug-free lifestyle among youths, as well as supporting Singapore’s candidature for the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) membership from 2024 to 2027.

The Mobile Diary will be integrated with CNB’s case management system, Integrated Drug Enforcement Administrative System II (IDEAS II), for better resource optimisation and to streamline information sharing within CNB and with other relevant parties for more effective enforcement capabilities.

4.         Assoc Prof Faishal also emphasised the need to support drug abusers in their rehabilitation to help them lead a drug-free life. Since November 2019, CNB has been piloting the Community Supervision Skills (CoSS) sessions, which aim to better address supervisees’ reintegration needs through structured interviews at supervision sessions to facilitate referrals to the Industrial & Services Co-Operative Society (ISCOS). ISCOS will then channel supervisees to relevant social service agencies for assistance.

5.         Amidst the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, CNB remains committed to realising the vision of a drug-free Singapore. CNB kept up a high operational tempo in 2020, making significant drug seizures and dismantling 24 drug syndicates. In his message delivered at the event, Director CNB, Mr Ng Ser Song, said that drug syndicates would continue to seek inroads into the local drug market, increase their activities and expand their influence even during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and he called upon CNB officers to remain vigilant in their fight against drugs.

6.         Looking ahead, CNB will continue to adopt a comprehensive approach to drug control by intensifying preventive drug education efforts, keeping our laws relevant, strengthening enforcement and supervision, and sustaining engagement with community and international partners. These include working with youths and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to produce targeted anti-drug messaging and promote a drug-free lifestyle among youths, as well as supporting Singapore’s candidature for the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) membership from 2024 to 2027.

4.         Investigations into the drug activities of the suspect are ongoing. CNB is aware that in various jurisdictions around the world, some have decriminalised or legalised cannabis, and they allow the sale of cannabis and/or products containing cannabis. There is scant evidence of the safety and efficacy of long-term cannabis use. These findings corroborate Singapore’s position that cannabis should remain an illicit drug.

5.         CNB would like to remind the public that cannabis is addictive and harmful, and is a Class A controlled drug listed under Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). The consumption, possession, trafficking, import or export of any controlled drugs, including cannabis and cannabis products, is an offence under the MDA.

6.         CNB would also like to urge parents to play an active part to protect our youths from the menace of drugs, and to remind their children that they should not consume products unknown to them, or offered by strangers. To entice more youths to consume these products, they are often disguised as candy or other food products. Members of the public can contact the CNB hotline at 1800-325-6666 for advice and assistance if they come across such suspected food products, or are worried that their children may be involved with drugs.

2.         Following the listing of the 13 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Persons found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject abusers of these NPS to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court.

3.         Their listing in the First Schedule will allow CNB to take decisive action against the abuse and trafficking of such substances.

Global NPS Situation

4.         There has been a rapid increase in the number, types and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in April 2021 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 1,047 NPS reported from 2008 to December 20202.

5.         Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB regularly reviews its strategies to improve the detection and regulation of NPS, including the regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are currently controlled under the MDA.

Two other Singaporean males (aged 62 and 25) were also arrested together with the female suspect for suspected drug-related offences as well. The three suspects were escorted to their hideout, an apartment in the same vicinity. 


3.          The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) was alerted when CNB found other illicit medicines in the apartment. During a search of the apartment, HSA seized approximately 16 litres of cough syrup in cannisters and bottles, and more than 4,500 units of unlabelled tablets and pills. The total street value of these illicit medicines is approximately $9,300. Preliminary investigations revealed that the apartment was used to illegally manufacture and store the cough syrup and medicines. Instruments used for mixing and rebottling, such as a high-speed industrial blender, funnels and measuring containers, were also seized.

The abuse of fentanyl results in similar effects to other opioids, such as nausea, drowsiness, respiratory depression, low blood pressure and slow heart rate. Due to its potency, fentanyl abuse brings with it a heightened risk of death as a result of overdosing and there have been many cases in overseas jurisdictions of overdose deaths relating to fentanyl and its derivatives.




5.         Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. CNB would like to remind the public that fentanyl and its derivatives are listed as Class A controlled drugs under Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). The possession, consumption, importation or trafficking of any controlled drug is an offence under the MDA. Singapore adopts a zero tolerance stance in our fight against drug abuse. Any person who is found to have committed an offence involving a controlled drug will be dealt with in accordance to the law. Anyone who imports, manufactures and / or supplies illegal health products is liable to prosecution and if convicted, may be imprisoned for up to 2 years and / or fined up to $50,000 under the Health Products Act.

Illicit drug abuse exacts a high cost on abusers, their families, and ultimately, society as a whole.
 
In 2020, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) had conducted intensive enforcement operations and had dismantled 24 drug syndicates. CNB also worked closely with other Home Team agencies to conduct over 500 operations across Singapore, including at various checkpoints to intercept attempts to smuggle drugs into Singapore.
 
While the number of drug abusers arrested decreased by 13% in 2020, there were several worrying trends. The proportion of new drug abusers arrested remained high at 38%, and the proportion of new drug abusers arrested under 30 years old remained significant at 62%. Drug seizures also remained high in 2020.
 
CNB continually reviews our anti-drug strategy to stay ahead of the evolving drug landscape. In September 2020, the First Schedule to the MDA was further amended with the Synthetic Cannabinoid generic groups revised and expanded, and a new generic description to deal with Lysergic acid and diethylamide analogues was introduced to strengthen our enforcement levers against new psychoactive substances.
 
Despite the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, CNB has remained steadfast in its mission of keeping Singapore drug-free, while also contributing to the national COVID-19 response. Close to 100 CNB officers were involved in the national COVID-19 response by taking on duties including contact-tracing, conducting checks on persons subject to Stay-Home Notices (SHNs), as well as in managing dormitory operations. COVID-19 also did not put a stop to CNB’s preventive drug education (PDE) efforts and many outreach activities, including community engagement events and PDE talks, were brought online.
 
Singapore’s approach has worked well for us and has helped keep the drug situation under control. CNB will continue in our efforts to prevent drug abuse from harming our people and society, and keep Singapore drug-free for our future generations.

2.           Targeted at preschoolers, Be Careful, Max! introduces the topic of stranger danger and serves as a useful resource for parents and educators to better engage children on rejecting offers of unknown substances and encouraging them to seek help from trusted adults. Be Careful, Max! is designed for interactive storytelling sessions, with animal characters and pop-up flaps to involve children in the reading activity. The book also features the Anti-Drug Ribbon, the symbol of the anti-drug cause and Singapore’s united stand against drugs.

3.           Be Careful, Max! is a collaboration between CNB and three graduates from Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Design & Media, and conceptualised in consultation with the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Preschool Education Branch.

4.           The hybrid book launch was livestreamed to the public, and featured a video montage of a pre-recorded storytelling session involving PCF Sparkletots teachers and kindergarten students (aged between 5 and 6), as well as students singing and dancing to the anti-drug jingle and participating in an origami anti-drug ribbon folding activity.

5.           Speaking at the event, Associate Professor Faishal emphasised the role of parents and educators in preventing drug abuse among the young, adding that preventive drug education remains the first line of defence against drugs, and family and communal support can help youths lead a healthy and positive drug-free lifestyle. “We find that it is important for families and educators to come forward to play a part, and share some of the meaningful opportunities where they can spend time with their kids, and look at things in a very positive way and help their kids to grow up healthy,” said Associate Professor Faishal, adding: “We hope that the preschool students and children will not only have an interactive and fun time reading the book, but at the same time, learn to be careful, pick up healthy habits, and avoid getting themselves involved in unhealthy activities as they grow up.”

6.           Copies of Be Careful, Max! have been distributed to selected preschool operators and community libraries. The web version of Be Careful, Max! can be found at CNB’s website https://www.cnb.gov.sg/educational-resources/pde-publications/interactive-book.

5.           Speaking at the event, Associate Professor Faishal emphasised the role of parents and educators in preventing drug abuse among the young, adding that preventive drug education remains the first line of defence against drugs, and family and communal support can help youths lead a healthy and positive drug-free lifestyle. “We find that it is important for families and educators to come forward to play a part, and share some of the meaningful opportunities where they can spend time with their kids, and look at things in a very positive way and help their kids to grow up healthy,” said Associate Professor Faishal, adding: “We hope that the preschool students and children will not only have an interactive and fun time reading the book, but at the same time, learn to be careful, pick up healthy habits, and avoid getting themselves involved in unhealthy activities as they grow up.”

6.           Copies of Be Careful, Max! have been distributed to selected preschool operators and community libraries. The web version of Be Careful, Max! can be found at CNB’s website https://www.cnb.gov.sg/educational-resources/pde-publications/interactive-book.

512,Cannabis Products Smuggled into Singapore via Parcel,2022-01-24,https://www.cnb.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/News/Index/cannabis-products-smuggled-into-singapore-via-parcel," On 20 January 2022, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers foiled an attempt to smuggle about 7g of cannabis and cannabis products in a parcel. This led to the arrest of a 24-year-old Singaporean woman for suspected drug-related offences by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).

2.           In the morning of 20 January, ICA officers at the Parcel Post Section had noticed anomalies in the scanned images of the parcel while performing screening. The parcel was declared as cosmetic products. Upon further checks, a total of about 7g of cannabis, sweets believed to have been infused with cannabis, and vaporisers containing cannabis extracts were found inside the parcel. ICA immediately alerted CNB for action.

3.           In a follow-up operation conducted on the same day, CNB officers arrested a 24-year-old Singaporean woman in the vicinity of Upper East Coast Road. 24 LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) stamps and two vaporisers containing cannabis extracts were further seized.

 On 3 January 2022, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers foiled an attempt to smuggle 5.8kg of kratom leaves in an arriving Malaysia-registered lorry via the Woodlands Checkpoint. The detection prompted subsequent enforcement operations by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in which a total of five suspected male drug offenders, comprising a 33-year-old Singaporean and four Malaysians aged between 27 and 40, were arrested at multiple locations in Singapore over 3 and 4 January. 2.           In the morning of 3 January, ICA officers noticed anomalies in the scanned images of the lorry conveying a consignment of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles. Upon further checks, a trash bag containing 22 bundles of about 5.8kg of kratom leaves was found in the lorry battery compartment. The 33-year-old Malaysian driver was immediately arrested and referred to CNB for investigation. 3.           In a follow-up operation conducted on the same day, CNB officers arrested a 33-year-old Singaporean man and a 40-year-old Malaysian man in the vicinity of Pandan Loop. Subsequently, a 27-year-old Malaysian man was arrested in the vicinity. In another follow-up operation conducted in the afternoon of 4 January, CNB officers arrested a 31-year-old Malaysian man in a commercial building located in the vicinity of Beach Road. 4.           Investigations into the drug activities and suspects are ongoing. Kratom contains ‘Mitragynine’ and ‘7-Hydroxymitragynine’, which are both Class A controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The importation of these Class A controlled drugs into Singapore is an offence that, upon conviction, carries a minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. 5.           Our borders are our first line of defence in safeguarding Singapore’s security. The ICA and CNB will continue to conduct security checks at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle undesirable persons, weapons, explosives, controlled drugs and other contrabands across our borders.
